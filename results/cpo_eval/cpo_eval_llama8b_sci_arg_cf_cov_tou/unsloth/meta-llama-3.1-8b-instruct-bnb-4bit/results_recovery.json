My opponent claims that churches should not be tax exempt. I, on the other hand, believe that churches should be tax exempt. In this debate, I will present arguments that churches should be tax exempt and respond to my opponent's arguments. I. Churches as a Non-Profit Organization Churches are non-profit organizations that provide essential services to their communities. They provide spiritual guidance, education, and social services to their members and the wider community. In the United States, churches are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This tax exemption is not a handout, but rather a recognition of the important role that churches play in society. II. Economic Benefits of Church Tax Exemption Churches that are tax-exempt are more likely to invest in their communities and provide economic benefits to their members and the wider community. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that churches that are tax-exempt are more likely to provide jobs, housing, and other economic benefits to their members. In contrast, churches that are taxed may be less likely to invest in their communities and provide economic benefits. III.

Furthermore, many churches rely on donations and other forms of support to operate, and taxing them could make it more difficult for them to receive these resources.

The first point of the argument for school uniforms is that they promote equality and reduce social conflicts. When students wear uniforms, they are all dressed in the same way, which eliminates the competition and comparison that comes with wearing different clothes. This helps to reduce social conflicts and promotes a sense of equality among students. The second point of the argument for school uniforms is that they improve academic performance. When students wear uniforms, they are less distracted by what other students are wearing, and they are more focused on their studies. This helps to improve academic performance and increase student success. The third point of the argument for school uniforms is that they reduce bullying and violence. When students wear uniforms, they are less likely to be bullied or victimized because of what they are wearing. This helps to reduce bullying and violence in schools. The fourth point of the argument for school uniforms is that they promote school spirit and unity.

In fact, the union was already established and the worker had to join as a condition of employment. This means that the worker did not have a choice in whether or not to join the union, and therefore, the union is undemocratic. Secondly, labor unions reward sloth. The fact that labor unions protect poorly performing workers means that the workers who are not performing well are not fired. This means that they are rewarded for their lack of effort, rather than being held accountable for their performance. This can lead to a lack of productivity and efficiency in the workplace.

The debate revolves around the right of citizens to bear arms, as enshrined in the Second Amendment, and the need to regulate firearms to prevent violence and crime. Proponents of gun control argue that stricter laws are necessary to reduce the incidence of gun-related violence and prevent mass shootings, while supporters of the Second Amendment argue that the right to bear arms is essential to individual liberty and the preservation of democracy. In this essay, we will examine the arguments for and against gun control and the Second Amendment rights.

On one hand, proponents of gun control argue that the right to bear arms is not absolute and that certain regulations are necessary to protect public safety.

While it is true that human achievement and progress have always been driven by the desire to push beyond what is thought possible, the use of performance-enhancing drugs raises significant concerns about fairness, safety, and the integrity of competition. Here are some counterarguments to consider: Firstly, the use of performance-enhancing drugs undermines the very concept of fair competition. If athletes are using drugs to enhance their performance, it is unfair to those who are not, and it creates an uneven playing field. This is particularly problematic in sports where the outcome is often determined by a single event or performance, such as in golf or tennis.

There are several reasons why high school students should be required to take a standardized exit exam.

The CDC has reported a significant increase in e-cigarette use among youth, with 13.4% of high school students using e-cigarettes in 2014, up from 4.5% in 2013. This trend is concerning, as e-cigarettes can lead to nicotine addiction and may not be an effective tool for quitting traditional cigarettes. In fact, the NCBI has published studies that suggest e-cigarettes may actually contribute to nicotine addiction and are unlikely to discourage conventional cigarette smoking among youth. The e-liquid or propylene glycol used in e-cigarettes has also been linked to health effects, including respiratory problems and other adverse outcomes.

The issue of homosexuality being illegal is a complex and controversial topic. Some people believe that homosexuality should be illegal due to religious or cultural beliefs, while others believe that it should be legal due to human rights and equality. In this debate, we will examine the arguments for and against homosexuality being illegal. Argument in favor of homosexuality being illegal: One argument in favor of homosexuality being illegal is that it is considered a sin in many religions. In some cultures, homosexuality is seen as a threat to traditional values and social norms. For example, in some African countries, homosexuality is illegal due to cultural and religious beliefs. Another argument is that homosexuality is seen as a deviant behavior that goes against societal norms. Some people believe that homosexuality is a choice and that individuals who engage in homosexual acts are making a conscious decision to do so. They argue that this choice should be punished with imprisonment or other forms of punishment. Argument against homosexuality being illegal: On the other hand, there are many arguments against homosexuality being illegal.

Humans have increased Climate Change because of Increased deforestation Source: \"Climate Change: A Quick Guide.\" Climate Change: A Quick Guide. The World Bank, 2015. Web. 12 Feb. 2016. Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests, usually as a result of human activities like agriculture, urbanization, logging and mining. The majority of deforestation occurs in the tropics, where forests are cleared to make way for agricultural crops like soybeans and palm oil, as well as to harvest timber. Trees are a key component in the global carbon cycle, absorbing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and storing it in their biomass and soils. The removal of trees reduces the ability of the land to act as a carbon sink, leading to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Deforestation contributes to 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, deforestation contributes to 14% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. In Brazil, deforestation contributes to 70% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. This shows how much deforestation contributes to pollution. 3.
