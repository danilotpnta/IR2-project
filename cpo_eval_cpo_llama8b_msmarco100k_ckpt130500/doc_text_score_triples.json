learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete!\n\"\u2014Bellatrix regarding her own loyalty and skill  [src]Bellatrix Lestrange  (n\u00e9e Black) ( 1951 \u2013 2 May, 1998) was a pure-blood witch, the eldest daughter of Cygnus Black III and Druella Black (n\u00e9e Rosier) and elder sister of Andromeda Tonks and Narcissa Malfoy.\nShe was a member of the House of Black, an old wizarding family and one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight .\nBellatrix started her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1962 and was Sorted into Slytherin House .\nAfter graduating from Hogwarts she became a Death Eater.\nShe was fanatically loyal to Lord Voldemort and was among the most dangerous and sadistic of his followers.\nWhile Bellatrix and Narcissa married pure-blood wizards, Andromeda married Muggle-born Ted Tonks and was disowned by the family.\nAndromeda was burned off the Black family tree and they were forbidden to talk about her.\nAt the end of the First Wizarding War, while searching for information on Lord Voldemort: Bellatrix, Rodolphus Lestrange  (husband), Rabastan Lestrange  (brother-in-law), and Barty Crouch Jr took part in the torture of the Aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom driving them insane.\nThey were caught and sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban for torturing the two Aurors .\nBellatrix escaped from Azkaban in the 1996 mass break-out, along with nine other Death Eaters.\nShe participated in several battles of the Second Wizarding War, making it a particular goal to murder any relatives who were members of the Order of the Phoenix.\nShe successfully murdered two, her cousin Sirius Black and niece Nymphadora Tonks.\nBellatrix also murdered the Malfoy family 's former house-elf, Dobby  (who had become a firm ally of Harry Potter) with her silver knife.\nDuring the final battle, she was one of the last Death Eater standing.\nBellatrix was eventually killed in a duel by Molly Weasley, after her attempted murder of Molly Weasley 's daughter.\nBefore her death, Bellatrix secretly gave birth to an illegitimate daughter named Delphini, whom she conceived with her beloved master, Lord Voldemort.\nDelphini was conceived sometime after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996 and before Bellatrix's death at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.\n[10]Contents [ show]Biography\nEarly life  (1951-1970)\" Snape... was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.\nRosier and Wilkes \u2014 they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell.\nThe Lestranges \u2014 they're a married couple \u2014 they're in Azkaban.\n\"\u2014Bellatrix's time at Hogwarts was spend among a select group of Slytherins  [src]Bellatrix on the Black family tree\nBellatrix was born in 1951 to Cygnus Black III and Druella Black  (n\u00e9e Rosier), who raised her to be proud of her pure-blood heritage.\nShe was the elder sister of Andromeda and Narcissa Black  [11], though Bellatrix cut off contact with Andromeda when she married Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks and was disowned from the House of Black, as she told Voldemort in 1997 that neither she or Narcissa had \" set eyes on Andromeda since she married the Mudblood Tonks \".\n[12] Bellatrix also held her cousin Sirius Black in contempt for being a \" blood traitor \" for his different opinions on Muggles and Muggle-borns.\nBellatrix came from the pure-blood Black family, and as such she was given a rich lifestyle.\nBellatrix attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Slytherin House.\nShe eventually married Rodolphus Lestrange, a fellow wealthy pure-blood and Slytherin.\nAlthough they would later work together well in their service to Lord Voldemort, the marriage appeared to be nothing more than an obligatory fulfilment of her family's pure-blood marriage traditions.\nUnlike Narcissa and Andromeda, Bellatrix displayed no affection for her husband whatsoever, never even mentioning him in conversations nor bearing him any children.\nWhen Voldemort first rose to power, Bellatrix and Rodolphus joined the Death Eaters.\nAlready a powerful witch in her own right, Bellatrix received additional training in the Dark Arts from Voldemort himself.\nHe was her true love, the one to whom she spoke in a romantic manner and showed concern for.\nHowever, he never returned her feelings as he was incapable of understanding love and disliked the idea of being emotionally attached to anyone.\nFirst Wizarding War  (1970-1981)\" The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch!\nThrow us into Azkaban; we will wait!\nHe will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters!\nWe alone were faithful!\nWe alone tried to find him!\n\"\u2014Bellatrix's parting words to the Council of Magical Law  [src]When the First Wizarding War broke out, Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus both fought for Voldemort 's Death Eaters, and remained loyal to Voldemort throughout the wizarding war and even after he was defeated by Harry Potter.\nBellatrix is tried before the Council of Magical Law, along with her husband, her brother-in-law, and Barty Crouch Jr\nAfter the Dark Lord's fall on 31 October, 1981, Bellatrix and a group of Voldemort's followers, including Rodolphus, her brother-in-law Rabastan, and Barty Crouch Jr, managed to avoid capture or execution by Aurors, unlike most of their fellows.\nSeeking to find and revive their master, the group kidnapped Aurors and Order of the Phoenix members Alice and Frank Longbottom , just new parents to Neville Longbottom.\nBellatrix and her partners used the Cruciatus Curse to torture Alice and Frank for information on Voldemort's whereabouts, until the two captives were driven into insanity when they refused to divulge anything.\nThis crime caused a wave of fury upon the wizard community of such ferocity that the Ministry were critically pressured to find the culprits, and when the four were captured they were tried before the Council of Magical Law and sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.\nAs a result of the torture Alice and Frank spent the rest of their lives at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries and were unaware that they had a son together.\nBetween the wars  (1981-1995)Imprisonment\nBellatrix while imprisoned in Azkaban\nAfter the fall of the Dark Lord Bellatrix stood trial for her crimes.\nUnlike many other Death Eaters, she did not lie about her loyalty \u2014 she proudly claimed that she was loyal to Voldemort and that she would wait for his return.\n[13] Indeed, Bellatrix was so proud of her loyalty to Voldemort that, during her trial before the Council of Magical Law, she was said to have sat upon the chair she was chained to as if it were a throne.\nShe would later describe herself as the Dark Lord's most loyal follower and even Lord Voldemort, whom Bellatrix admired the most, gained a considerable amount of respect for her.\nBellatrix was sentenced to life in Azkaban with no chance of release.\nShe would spend the next fifteen years in a maximum security cell until her escape.\nHer time in Azkaban takes a toll on her already unstable mentality, as well as hollowing out her appearance until only the faintest traces of her familial beauty remained.\nHarry Potter later witnessed Bellatrix's trial in 1995 in a memory of Professor Dumbledore's.\n[14]Second Wizarding War  (1995-1998)Escape from Azkaban\" We have confirmed that ten high-security prisoners, in the early hours of yesterday evening, did escape... We strongly suspect that the breakout was engineered by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban; notorious mass murderer Sirius Black, cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\"\u2014 Daily Prophet regarding the 1996 Azkaban mass breakout  [src]When Voldemort returned to power in June 1995 he said that Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange were faithful members of his inner circle and should be rewarded, as they did not denounce him after they were captured and tried.\nVoldemort breaks Bellatrix out of Azkaban after fifteen years of imprisonment\nIn January 1996, a mass breakout from Azkaban set ten long-imprisoned Death Eaters loose.\nBellatrix was one of the ten who escaped in the mass breakout and rejoined Voldemort, as well as the Dementors.\nLord Voldemort had little trouble arranging this as many of the Dementors were happy to oblige his dark whims.\nThe Daily Prophet  (probably with encouragement from the Ministry of Magic) reported that the escaped criminal Sirius Black must be responsible for the incident.\nThese ten were considered to be some of the most dangerous and highly guarded convicts due to their crimes being brutal and legendary.\nAs a result, Bellatrix and her allies became wanted witches and wizards.\nThey lived in hiding to avoid being captured by the Ministry.\n[14]Battle of the Department of Mysteries\nMain article: Battle of the Department of Mysteries\" Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?\nYou need to mean them, Potter.\nYou need to really want to cause pain \u2014 to enjoy it \u2014 righteous anger won't hurt me for long \u2014 I'll show you how it is done, shall I?\nI'll give you a lesson \u2014 Crucio!\n\"\u2014Bellatrix teaching Harry Potter a lesson on the Unforgivable Curses  [src]Neville Longbottom threatening Bellatrix in the Hall of Prophecy\nLater that very same year, Bellatrix and her family were part of a Death Eater task force led by Lucius Malfoy, participating in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in a plot to steal a prophecy regarding Harry Potter and the Dark Lord.\nShe was enraged when Harry spoke Voldemort's given name and mentioned his true status as a half-blood, actually trying to curse him before Lucius deflected her spell.\nShe also recognised Neville Longbottom and later tortured him just like she tortured his parents.\nShe was very condescending when dealing with the six D.\nA. members.\nBellatrix tried unsuccessfully to retrieve the prophecy from Harry Potter via a Summoning Charm, but her efforts were stopped by Harry's quick use of a Shield Charm.\nShe was also willing to do whatever it took to get the prophecy from Harry, including gleefully and sadistically threatening to torture fourteen year old Ginny Weasley with the Cruciatus Curse while he was forced to watch.\nBellatrix duelling Sirius Black in the Death Chamber\nWhen the Order of the Phoenix members arrived, Bellatrix duelled and defeated her niece, Nymphadora Tonks, then began fighting her cousin, Sirius Black.\nSirius taunted her about the wicked Black Family and their pure-blood beliefs.\nBellatrix then struck Sirius with a spell that sent him through the veil guarding the Death Chamber, killing him.\nAfter Sirius's death, Bellatrix defeated Kingsley Shacklebolt before going on the run, being the sole Death Eater to escape being captured by Dumbledore when he arrived.\nDriven into a rage at the loss of his only loving relative, Harry pursued her all the way to the Atrium in an attempt to avenge his godfather.\nHe attempted the Cruciatus Curse but only knocked her over and caused her a few seconds of pain.\nShe taunted him and teasingly \u2014 yet correctly \u2014 taught him to how to do it properly.\nVoldemort arrived at the Ministry shortly after Harry attempted to torture Bellatrix into insanity.\nBellatrix pleaded to Voldemort not to be punished and tried to warn him that Albus Dumbledore was nearby, but he ignored her and concentrated on attempting to kill Harry.\nAs he was about to cast the Killing Curse, Dumbledore arrived and enchanted the statues of the Fountain of Magical Brethren to protect Harry and act as reinforcements; to ensure that she could not intervene, Bellatrix was pinned to the ground by the newly sentient witch statue.\nBefore duelling Voldemort, Dumbledore summoned Cornelius Fudge and some Aurors to the department.\nAfter the duel, Fudge and the Aurors arrived.\nVoldemort, having been seen by the public before he vanished, grabbed Bellatrix before Apparating away.\nShe was the only Death Eater whom he took the time to help.\nThe remaining ones were captured by Aurors and sent back to Azkaban .\nPlot against Albus Dumbledore\" I don't trust you, Snape, as you very well know!...\nWhere were you when the Dark Lord fell?\n\"\u2014Bellatrix questions Severus Snape 's loyalty  [src]Bellatrix sealing the Unbreakable Vow between Narcissa and Snape\nIn July of 1996, Bellatrix reluctantly accompanied her sister, Narcissa Malfoy, to the house of Severus Snape at Spinner's End.\nOnce there, Bellatrix interrogated Snape and voiced her distrust of him.\nSnape's calm, reasonable, and logical answers to her aggressive questioning rendered her dissatisfied, but temporarily without retort.\nNarcissa, however, proceeded to beg Snape to look after her son Draco 's welfare while he attended Hogwarts and tried to fulfil Voldemort's orders to kill Albus Dumbledore.\nSnape shocked Bellatrix by asking her to bind him and Narcissa with an Unbreakable Vow to assist Draco.\nBellatrix also assisted her nephew in his task by teaching him Occlumency, a tool he used against Snape in order to conceal the details of his mission.\nBellatrix showed her obsessive loyalty to her master's cause in telling her sister that she should be proud, instead of worried, that her son was not \" shrinking away from his duty .\n\"Battle of the Seven Potters\nMain article: Meeting at Malfoy Manor\nBellatrix: \" My Lord, it is an honour to have you here, in our family's house.\nThere can be no higher pleasure.\n\"Lord Voldemort: \" No higher pleasure... That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.\n\"Bellatrix: \" My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!\n\"\u2014 Bellatrix's delight at Voldemort staying at Malfoy Manor  [src]Bellatrix addressing Voldemort in Malfoy Manor during a Death Eater meeting\nBy the next year, Bellatrix was living with Narcissa at Malfoy Manor.\nShe was the only resident of the manor who was actually pleased that Voldemort was staying there, telling him that there was \" no higher pleasure \".\nDespite her unwavering loyalty, her master humiliated her and the Malfoys by mentioning the marriage of Nymphadora Tonks, the daughter of Bellatrix and Narcissa's sister, to the werewolf Remus Lupin.\nBellatrix insisted that she and Narcissa did not consider Nymphadora to be their niece, as they had disowned her mother (for marrying Nymphadora's father, a Muggle-born).\nVoldemort eventually stopped the teasing and advised Bellatrix to \"prune\" her \"family tree\", which she eagerly agreed to do as soon as possible.\nWhen the Death Eaters subsequently attacked the Order of the Phoenix while they were moving Harry Potter from 4 Privet Drive, Bellatrix and her husband pursued a disguised Ronald Weasley and Tonks, whom Bellatrix tried very hard to kill.\nRodolphus was injured in the pursuit and Tonks escaped.\nSoon afterwards, a copy of Godric Gryffindor's Sword was secured in Bellatrix's family vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank on Voldemort's orders, with Voldemort and Bellatrix both unaware at the time, that it was merely a copy.\nSkirmish at Malfoy Manor\nMain article: Skirmish at Malfoy Manor\" You're lying, you filthy Mudblood, and I know it!\nYou have been inside my vault at Gringotts!\nTell the truth, tell the truth!\nWhat else did you take?\nWhat else have you got?\nTell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!\nWhat else did you take, what else?\nANSWER ME!\nCRUCIO!\n\"\u2014Overheard parts of Bellatrix's interrogation of Hermione Granger  [src]Bellatrix sees the Sword of Gryffindor and retaliates against the Snatchers who possess it\nIn March 1998, when Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were captured by a group of Snatchers and brought to the manor with Godric Gryffindor's sword, Bellatrix panicked.\nThis led Harry to deduce that there could be something of great importance in her vault \u2014Voldemort's Horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff's Cup.\nBellatrix, coming out of her panicked state, rapidly stunned all the Snatchers present.\nShe intended to kill them at a later date, as Draco was unwilling to do so himself.\nShe also had Draco try and identify Harry, as his face was unrecognisable due to a well placed Stinging Hex from Hermione.\nThis was in an effort to disguise his and by extension her and Ron's identities.\nDraco was hesitant and offered no solid proof that they had Harry in custody.\nHarry and Ron were then separated from Hermione.\nBellatrix brutally torturing Hermione Granger with the Cruciatus Curse\nBellatrix interrogated Hermione and brutally tortured her with the Cruciatus Curse.\nEven in extreme pain Hermione managed to lie, claiming the real sword was only a copy.\n[12] But Bellatrix thought that maybe Harry and his friends got the sword from her vault, so she told Peter Pettigrew to get goblin Griphook from the cellar to tell her if the sword was fake or not.\nGriphook also managed to lie, obeying Harry's request and keeping the trio's secret safe.\nAfter Pettigrew was strangled to death in the cellar with his own silver hand, by showing mercy and loosening the grip he had on Harry's throat, Harry and Ron escaped the cellar and proceeded up the stairs to aid Hermione.\nBellatrix pressing her silver dagger to Hermione Granger's throat\nBellatrix threatened Hermione with her knife, after Harry stunned Greyback and Lucius and Ron disarmed her.\nWhile holding the knife to an unconscious Hermione's throat, Bellatrix demanded that the prisoners drop their wands, and then pressed her Dark Mark, calling Voldemort.\nHowever, Dobby Apparated and created a diversion and caused the chandelier to fall from above Bellatrix's head, making her release Hermione and jump out of the way.\nShe lashed out at the house-elf in complete disbelief of his rebellious action to his \"former masters\".\nDobby claimed he was a \"free elf\" and Disapparated.\nAs the house-elf Disapparated with Harry, Bellatrix threw the knife at them in a desperate attempt to prevent their escape, and the Apparition sucked up the knife with it, wounding Dobby in his chest, who died.\nShe and her relatives were severely punished by Voldemort for allowing Harry to escape.\nBellatrix also lost her wand in the skirmish.\nAfter the incident at Malfoy Manor, Hermione used the hair of Bellatrix that had fallen on her while Bellatrix was torturing her to change herself into Bellatrix, therefore letting her sneak into Gringotts  (Diagon Alley was infested with Death Eaters).\nDuel with Molly Weasley and death\" Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.\nBellatrix's gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: for the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.\n\"\u2014Description of Bellatrix's demise at the hands of Molly Weasley  [src]During the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, Bellatrix finally succeeded in murdering Nymphadora Tonks, her estranged sister 's daughter.\n[9] When Voldemort called a temporary retreat, waiting for Harry Potter to turn himself in, Bellatrix waited by his side; she offered him help when he was dazed after using the Killing Curse on Harry, but was coldly rebuffed.\nBellatrix eagerly asked Voldemort if she could check Harry for signs of life, but was refused and instead he sent her younger sister to confirm his death.\nWhen Narcissa had lied and told Voldemort that Harry was dead, Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters (and supporters) followed Voldemort to Hogwarts to announce Harry's \"death\".\nBellatrix in particular gloated at the survivors' despair.\nBellatrix duelling Molly Weasley during the second half of the final battle\nWhen the battle resumed, Bellatrix fought Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood all at once.\nShe did this just as her master fought three by himself.\nIt was said that despite all three young witches being skilled, combined they did not equal Bellatrix's magical abilities.\nShe had more duelling experience and a wider arsenal of spells.\nBellatrix became the last Death Eater standing, aside from Voldemort.\nShe cast a Killing Curse at Ginny, which missed by less than an inch; this enraged Molly Weasley, who promptly threw off her cloak and shouted a vocal challenge to the Death Eater as she charged.\nBellatrix did not take Molly seriously in the least.\nShe initially taunted Molly over the death of her son, cruelly calling him \"Freddie\".\nA dead Bellatrix at Molly Weasley's feet\nThe duel continued, however, and the ground beneath the two witches was said to become hot and cracked as their battle progressed.\nWhile Bellatrix laughed at her opponent, Molly managed to strike her in the chest with a curse which proved fatal.\nAs her body toppled to the ground, an outraged Voldemort turned on Molly.\nThis prompted Harry, who had watched the battle unfold beneath his Invisibility Cloak, to reveal himself, and the final showdown between him and Voldemort ensued.\nBellatrix did not live to find out that her mistrust of Snape had been valid and she did not live to see her master's final defeat moments later.\n[12]Physical appearance\" A woman with thick, shining dark hair, long eyelashes and heavily hooded eyes\u2026 was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne.\n\"\u2014Bellatrix's outward apperance at her trial  [src]Bellatrix, age 46Bellatrix was described as a tall dark woman with long, thick shiny dark hair, thin lips, heavily-lidded eyes with long eyelashes, and a strong jaw.\nShe had the classic 'great good looks' and arrogant bearing common for members of the House of Black, but her time in Azkaban took a toll on her appearance.\nAs a Death Eater, Bellatrix bears the Dark Mark on her inner left forearm.\nAfter her lengthy imprisonment, she was described as having a gaunt and skull-like face, but managed to retain some vestige of her great beauty.\n[14] Bellatrix was noted to greatly resemble her younger sister, Andromeda Tonks, at first glance.\nHowever, Andromeda has lighter brown hair, a kinder face, and wider eyes.\nHarry Potter also noted that as much as Narcissa Malfoy  (her youngest sister) is fair as Bellatrix is dark, the two sisters still resembled each other.\n[15]Personality and traits\" Let him watch while we torture the little girl.\nI'll do it.\n\"\u2014Bellatrix gleefully threatens to torture Ginny Weasley  [src]Bellatrix was an intensely sadistic witch with brutal, violent tendencies.\n[15] She was intelligent, but could be easily distracted.\nShe also possessed a fierce and dangerous temper, a trait that she shared with her cousin Sirius and her aunt Walburga.\nShe was immensely proud of her status as the most loyal and devoted follower of Lord Voldemort.\nBellatrix cruelly laughing at the defenders of Hogwarts reactions to the announcement of Harry Potter's 'death'Bellatrix was slavishly devoted to Lord Voldemort, believing that she proved her loyalty by her time in Azkaban, which seems to have furthered her mental decline.\nShe was Voldemort's most trusted and loyal follower.\nBellatrix was also one of his cruellest Death Eaters, always eager to inflict the Cruciatus Curse on enemies and her family members; Harry Potter noted that Bellatrix was as \" mad as her master .\"\n[14]Bellatrix was egotistical and arrogant, described by Harry Potter as \" treat [ing] everyone like scum .\"\nShe was obsessed with blood purity and took immense pride in the aristocracy and pure-blood of her family.\nLike all the rest of Lord Voldemort's followers she was vehemently against all: blood traitors, half-bloods, Muggle-borns, Muggles, and half-breeds.\nAlso she was not above killing members of her own family who displeased her.\nIronically Voldemort himself was half-blood.\nGiven her reaction to Harry's words that Voldemort is half-blood, it is likely that she didn't know that her master was not pure-blood.\nBellatrix was a natural leader and took charge in tricky situations, such as during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor.\nAnother mark of her decisiveness and ruthlessness was that Bellatrix took no unnecessary prisoners (preferring to kill them instead) as she planned to do with a group of Snatchers who attempted to defy her in Malfoy Manor in 1998.\n[12] In ways, Bellatrix was like Minerva Mc\nGonagall; both were very powerful witches who were unfailingly devoted to their cause and their leader's greatest deputy.\nHowever, Mc\nGonagall (like most on her side) only trusted Snape because Dumbledore did, whereas Bellatrix never trusted Snape despite her master doing so.\nDespite her cruel personality, she was not incapable of caring for a few people.\nShe was obsessively in love with her master, Lord Voldemort.\nShe was also sexually attracted to him and the two eventually conceived a child (a daughter named Delphini) born between the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of Hogwarts.\nBellatrix hid her daughter as a secret from the world.\nBellatrix also did not seem to care for her husband, due to her having an affair during their marriage.\nShe had a close relationship with her younger sister, Narcissa Malfoy.\nShe grudgingly went with Narcissa to Severus Snape 's house when Narcissa wanted to ask Snape to help Draco and did not tell her master of Narcissa's deception.\nShe also showed affection for her nephew Draco Malfoy, teaching him Occlumency and possibly other skills.\nMagical abilities and skills\nBellatrix casts the Killing Curse on her cousin, Sirius Black\" She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience.\n\"\u2014 Harry Potter regarding Bellatrix's duelling skills  [src]Bellatrix Lestrange was an extremely powerful and dangerous witch.\nShe was a mistress of the Dark Arts, an incredibly skilful duellist, and an Occlumens.\nHer prodigious duelling skill was proven by her many victories over numerous talented wizards and witches, including experienced Aurors .\nDark Arts: Bellatrix claimed to have been trained in the Dark Arts by Voldemort himself, and displayed particular proficiency with the Cruciatus Curse.\nShe boasted to have knowledge of Dark spells that few could comprehend the power of  [14]; a claim supported by her status as Voldemort's \"best lieutenant\".\nLike her master, Bellatrix was capable of casting the Killing Curse with no regard for the life she wished to extinguish.\nHowever, unlike the Dark Lord, she usually preferred to torture her victims rather than killing them straight away, doing so with such skill her victims would pass out or even go to the point of insanity.\n[15]  [12]Non-verbal magic: Bellatrix also seemed highly adept at using non-verbal spells.\nShe killed a fox with a flash of green light on her way to Spinner's End, in 1996, which was highly likely to have been a non-verbal Killing Curse and ferociously duelled Molly Weasley with such intensity that the floor around her became \"hot and cracked\" without mentioning a single incantation.\nShe also fired a curse at Harry, non-verbally, which caused a tank of brains to lift and tip itself onto him whilst he chased her in the Thought Chamber and furthermore fired several destructive curses at him without speaking in the Atrium at the Ministry of Magic, some of which were possibly Cruciatus curses.\nShe also decimated the Great Hall non-verbally, and used an unknown spell to bring Greyback to his knees at Malfoy Manor.\nDuelling: Bellatrix Lestrange was an incredibly skilful duellist.\nShe defeated and seriously injured Nymphadora Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt in duels during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, as well as killed her cousin Sirius, altough Sirius was hindered by his cockiness.\nBellatrix was even the only Death Eater to deflect a spell from Albus Dumbledore himself, allowing her to escape the renowned wizard.\n[14] She quickly and single-handedly defeated four Snatchers at Malfoy Manor and all four were described to be \"no match\".\nShe later murdered her niece, Nymphadora Tonks in battle.\nJust before her death Bellatrix duelled: Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood, and Ginny Weasley all at once and was described as being equal in skill to all three witches, as she was able to stalemate their combined efforts.\nHer death at the hands of Molly Weasley was due to her vastly underestimating the witch, who was fuelled by grief over the murder of her son.\n[12] Despite her years of captivity within Azkaban, Bellatrix displayed incredible reflexes that outmatched the much younger and physically-fit Harry Potter.\nShe was able to conjure a Shield Charm and deflect his own spell back at him the moment he cast it.\n[14] During the Battle of Hogwarts Bellatrix was the last Death Eater standing (apart from Lord Voldemort) and it should be noted that she was wielding a wand which she had most likely not won the allegiance of, which is further evidence of her extraordinary duelling skills.\nOcclumency: Bellatrix trained her nephew, Draco Malfoy, in Occlumency as part of his mission to kill Albus Dumbledore.\nThis training was effective enough that Draco was able to block out Severus Snape.\nIt is also possible that she could perform Legilimency, as she may have penetrated Draco's mind to train him to block his thoughts  [15]Charms: Bellatrix displayed a high amount of proficiency at Charms, given how she was the only Death Eater besides Voldemort to successfully block an attack from Dumbledore.\nHowever, she could not perform a Patronus Charm as she lacked the purity of heart required to cast it.\nFlying: Bellatrix was also a skilful flyer, as she participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters and evenly duelled with her niece, who was also proficient in flying a broomstick while flying.\nApparition: Bellatrix was skilled at Apparition.\nHowever, her sister Malfoy may be even more skilled than her.\nThis was demonstrated when they both apparated into Spinner's End, with Bellatrix's pop being somewhat louder and Narcissa making only a slight \"popping\" sound.\nWith Apparition, it was generally considered that the quieter the 'pop', the more skilled at Apparition that wizard or witch is, although Bellatrix may simply have been too desperate in chasing Narcissa to do it more quietly.\nIn the film adaptation, her Apparition manifested as plumes of black smoke.\nUnbreakable Vow: Bellatrix could cast a bonding spell to help make an Unbreakable Vow for Draco Malfoy, which could force Severus Snape to kill Albus Dumbledore and protect Draco regardless of whether he wanted to or not.\nTeaching skills: Bellatrix taught Draco Occlumency, the Unforgivable Curses, and several non-verbal spells before his sixth year of school started.\nShe also unwittingly taught Harry how to properly use the Unforgivable Curses, given how he acknowledged that his success on the Cruciatus Curse was actually from her taunting.\nRelationships\nFamily\nLord Voldemort: \" I'm talking about your niece, Bellatrix.\nAnd yours, Lucius and Narcissa.\nShe just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin.\nYou must be so proud.\n\"Bellatrix: \" She is no niece of ours, my Lord.\nWe \u2014 Narcissa and I \u2014 have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood.\nThis brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.\n\"\u2014 Voldemort discussing blood purity with fellow Death Eaters  [src]Nymphadora Tonks, her niece and murder victim\nBellatrix took the pure-blood values of her family very seriously, as indicated by her marriage into a known pure-blood wizarding family and her zealous belief in Death Eater ideology.\nShe had no feelings of affection for those in her family deemed blood traitors by disgracing and dishonouring her family by not fanatically honouring the prejudiced values she did, and readily attacked and killed them on many occasions.\nNarcissa Malfoy, her youngest sister\nShe seems to have had a fairly close and affectionate relationship with her younger sister Narcissa, whom she called \"Cissy.\"\nDespite distrusting Severus Snape and attempting to dissuade her sister from approaching him, Bellatrix accompanied Narcissa to Spinner's End to request Snape's help in seeing Draco Malfoy through the task assigned to him by Lord Voldemort in 1996.\nAfter Snape agreed to make the Unbreakable Vow, Bellatrix acted as Bonder, ensuring that Snape would fulfil his promises to Narcissa.\nNarcissa and Bellatrix occasionally clashed over the former's protectiveness towards her son; Bellatrix argued that Narcissa should be proud that her son was a Death Eater, while Narcissa consistently demonstrated that the safety of her son and husband were her first priorities.\nStill, the two seemed close, and, at some point, Bellatrix trained Draco in Occlumency to aid him in his mission.\n[15]Andromeda Tonks, Bellatrix's estranged younger sister\nOn the other hand, Bellatrix hated her \"blood traitor\" relatives.\nAfter her sister Andromeda married a muggle-born and was disowned, Bellatrix never saw her again  [12].\nShe shared a mutual loathing with her \"dear cousin\" Sirius Black, and the two taunted each other as they duelled during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.\nAfter killing Sirius, Bellatrix jeered at Harry about the death of his godfather on multiple occasions.\n[14]Bellatrix also eagerly attacked her niece, Nymphadora Tonks, on at least three occasions \u2014 this was likely for a combination of reasons, including Tonks' being a half-blood, an Auror, and member of the Order of the Phoenix, the fact that she had married a werewolf and Voldemort's comments to her about \"pruning her family tree\".\nBellatrix eventually murdered Tonks during the Battle of Hogwarts in May 1998.\nSirius Black, a cousin and murder victim\" I killed Sirius Black!\nI killed Sirius Black!\nYou going to get me?\nYou going to get me?\nYou going to get me?\n\"\u2014Bellatrix cruelly taunts Harry about murdering Sirius  [src]It is possible that Bellatrix was on good terms with her other cousin, Regulus, who was a Death Eater during the First Wizarding War.\nRegulus initially espoused the pure-blood supremacist line associated with his family, and like Bellatrix, was sorted into the Slytherin house during his time at Hogwarts.\nIt is unlikely that he revealed his change of heart to Bellatrix, or anyone else, prior to his death in 1979.\nHer relationship with Draco seemed to have some affection; though she seemed to disapprove of his inability to kill and his dislike for torture.\nShe taught him Occlumency, non-verbal spells, the Unforgivable Curses and other branches of the Dark Arts, making her already talented nephew a powerful wizard.\nHis blood relationship with her is probably the only reason he is still alive; due to his father's failure and Snape taking over his 1996-1997 task.\nSeeing Lucius's extreme failure and the confiscation of his wand, Bellatrix treated her brother-in-law with disdain and contempt, showing him little to no respect during their argument of summoning Voldemort for capturing Harry.\nDelphini\nBellatrix also had an illegitimate daughter with Lord Voldemort, named Delphini.\nDelphini was born in secret at Malfoy Manor in the late 1990s as the result of a liaison between Bellatrix and Voldemort.\n[16] Bellatrix did not live long enough to watch her daughter grow up; this left the infant Delphi an orphan as her father had been.\nEuphemia Rowle took Delphi in and raised her, allegedly only because she was offered a substantial amount of gold,  [17] but according to Delphi, Rowle was not fond of her.\n[17]Lord Voldemort\" She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanour; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness.\n\"\u2014Bellatrix demonstrates her obsession with Voldemort during the Meeting at Malfoy Manor  [src]Lord Voldemort, her master, with whom she was obsessively in love\nBellatrix was obsessively in love with Lord Voldemort.\n[9]  [18]  [19] Unlike many of the other Death Eaters, Bellatrix never attempted to deny her loyalties when her master fell in 1981.\nInstead she proudly claimed that she was his most loyal and trusted servant, and stated that he would rise again.\nShe seemed to view Azkaban prison as a mere place to wait for his return.\n[13] More than just being a fanatic, she shared his ideas of blood purity and fascination with the Dark Arts.\nSatisfying him was of the utmost importance to her.\nShe was perfectly willing to kill her niece, Nymphadora Tonks, as a way of \"pruning\" her \"family tree\".\nShe is described as being slavishly devoted to her master, regarding him with \"worshipful fascination\" and speaking to him in a romantic way.\n[12] On at least one occasion, during the 1997 meeting of Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor, her cheeks flushed and her eyes welled up with tears when she thought he was praising her.\nHe did not reciprocate her romantic feelings, as he did not know love.\nDue to his egotistical and self-centred nature, however, it is possible that he was at least pleased with her desire for him.\nHe may have even tried to reciprocate her feelings, as the two did conceive a child together.\nThe relationship, and the honour of bearing of his child, could have also been a reward to Bellatrix for her loyalty to him.\nPerhaps he just wanted an heir and Bellatrix willing gave him one, without any romantic feelings on his part.\nHowever, as he believed that he had a found a way to cheat death (through his Horcruxes), he most likely did not feel a need to leave an heir behind.\nHe respected her talents and skills, and apparently considered her of greater importance than most of his other servants.\nAt the conclusion of the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, he grabbed her and Apparated away with her.\nShe was the sole Death Eater whom he bothered to help.\nBellatrix was outraged by anyone showing her master the slightest disrespect.\nWhen Harry Potter called him by his name in 1996, she became enraged, feeling that he was unworthy of speaking the name.\nShe was also furious when Harry spoke of Voldemort's half-blood status and Muggle father.\nDespite agreeing with her master's ideology of blood purity, she apparently did not care that he himself was a half-blood, if she believed this at all.\nVoldemort might have falsely told her (as well as his other subordinates) that he was a pure-blood, something which Harry Potter suspected.\nIf so, she believed her master's lie over the truth from the enemy.\nWhen she was killed by Molly Weasley during the final battle, Voldemort's fury was said to \" explode like a bomb \".\nHer death was the only one that he attempted to avenge (before Harry Potter intervened).\nIt is unlikely, though, that he truly cared about her as a person.\nHe was angry about losing someone who was very useful to him.\nUnknown to nearly all, it would be revealed years later after her death that Bellatrix and Voldemort had in fact engaged in a sexual relationship, resulting in the birth of their daughter, Delphini, who was born at Malfoy Manor before Battle of Hogwarts.\nIt is highly likely that Voldemort used this as a way to reward Bellatrix for her undying loyalty to her master, and for her rather potent and notable successes as his most loyal lieutenant.\nRodolphus Lestrange\nIn marrying Rodolphus Lestrange, Bellatrix made a \" respectable pure-blood marriage \"  [14], as it was expected of her.\n[9] There is no indication that their relationship went beyond this.\nShe never expressed any love or concern for him.\nIt was Voldemort to whom she spoke in a romantic manner instead.\nShe and Rodolphus did seem to work effectively together as Death Eaters, further suggesting their partnership is strictly professional.\nRodolphus tortured Alice and Frank Longbottom alongside his wife, brother, and Barty Crouch Jr in 1981  [13].\nHe fought with Bellatrix during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries  [14].\nHe was also with her during the Battle of the Seven Potters, as Nymphadora Tonks mentioned cursing him and being pursued by Bellatrix  [12].\nSirius Black described them as part of the same \"gang of Slytherins\" at Hogwarts, which also included Lucius Malfoy, Evan Rosier, and Severus Snape  [14] .\nBellatrix once told Narcissa that if she had sons, she would \" be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord \".\n[15] No children appear beneath Bellatrix and Rodolphus's names on the Black family tapestry, indicating that she had no daughters from Rodolphus either.\nIt could be surmised that she made no attempts to produce children with her official husband, as she truly adored her master and concentrated on pleasing him.\nHarry Potter\" My Lord, I'd like to volunteer for this task.\nI want to kill the boy.\n\"\u2014Bellatrix's desire to kill Harry Potter  [src]Harry Potter, a hated enemy\nBellatrix Lestrange saw Harry Potter as her master's most hated enemy and despised him for the inexplicable threat he posed to the Dark Lord.\nShe thought of him as someone lesser than herself due to his status as a half-blood and wanted him dead very badly, she even volunteered herself for the task of murdering him in 1997, until Voldemort quietly stopped her.\nHarry had hated and feared Bellatrix ever since he first saw her in the Pensieve, learning that she was responsible for the attack on Alice and Frank Longbottom.\nHarry's attention was immediately drawn to Bellatrix's picture when the news of the ten escaped Death Eaters appeared in the Daily Prophet, and whenever he saw her image on wanted posters after that.\nDuring the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Harry fully intended to kill Bellatrix in retaliation for her murder of his godfather, and at the onset of the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, the mere sound of her voice when she appeared in the fray was enough to make his fear reach a new high.\nBellatrix also killed Dobby the house-elf and Nymphadora Tonks, and when she attempted to murder Ginny Weasley during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry was diverted from his goal of destroying Voldemort in the hopes of attacking her; he was stopped only by the sudden intervention of Molly Weasley .\nHarry's hatred for Bellatrix was intense enough for him to feel agitated when laying eyes on her sisters, both of whom resemble her.\nLongbottom family\nBellatrix: \" Longbottom?\nWhy I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy.... \"Neville Longbottom: \" I DOE YOU HAB!\n\"\u2014 Bellatrix cruelly mocking Neville about his parents  [src]Frank and Alice Longbottom.\nwhom she helped torture into insanity\nAfter the fall of the Dark Lord in 1981, Bellatrix along with three other Death Eaters (including her husband, Rodolphus Lestrange and the son of well known Bartemus Crouch, Barty Crouch Jr set out to attack members of the Order of the Phoenix, hoping to interrogate them for information on Voldemort's whereabouts.\nShe personally attacked Alice and Frank Longbottom, torturing them by means of the Cruciatus Curse in her attempt at forcing them to yield the information she wanted.\nThe event rendered the Aurors clinically and permanently insane, therefore condemning them to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for the remainder of their lives.\nPrior to the Longbottoms' capture and torture, Alice had given birth to a baby boy, Neville Longbottom.\nBellatrix threatens Neville Longbottom during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries\nNeville was left with parents incapable of even recognising him let alone caring for him, and so was raised by his grandmother.\nBellatrix seemed to find the fact that she had caused Neville's family tragedy highly amusing.\nUpon first meeting Neville, she proceeded to mock his loss, extremely angering him in the process.\nEver since he was old enough to understand why his parents needed to be hospitalised, Neville had despised Bellatrix Lestrange, but given his benign nature, he never sought vengeance against her.\nInstead, Neville honoured his parents by showing more bravery than anyone could have expected of him, retaliating, when Bellatrix taunted him, rebelling against the tyranny of the Carrows during his seventh year at Hogwarts and subsequently fighting during the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort and his forces.\nSeverus Snape\" I don't trust you, Snape, as you very well know!\n\"\u2014Bellatrix expressing her distrust in regards to Snape  [src]Severus Snape, whom she mistrusts\nSeverus Snape was a Death Eater prior to the end of the First Wizarding War, changing sides shortly before Voldemort 's 1981 downfall, and becoming a triple agent for Albus Dumbledore.\nBellatrix was highly suspicious of him, possibly because of Snape's half-blood status, though mainly citing his evading a sentence to Azkaban \" in Dumbledore's pocket ;\" mistrust may also have been Bellatrix's only real way of expressing her envy of the position of trust and respect Snape enjoyed under Voldemort.\nIn 1996, Bellatrix followed Narcissa to Snape's house, trying to dissuade her from seeking his help in guiding and guarding Draco in the task of killing Albus Dumbledore.\nBellatrix was taken aback by Snape's conformance in making the Unbreakable Vow, for which she acted as a Bonder.\nBoth she and Snape fought at the Battle of Hogwarts, Bellatrix dying, however, before being able to discover that her initial mistrust of Snape had been valid after all.\nAlbus Dumbledore\"  [...] or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it  [...] \"\u2014Albus Dumbledore regarding Bellatrix's sadistic tendencies  [src]Albus Dumbledore, a hated enemy\nAlbus Dumbledore knew Bellatrix to be a highly dangerous Death Eater since the First Wizarding War, having also witnessed her trial and imprisonment, after she tortured the Aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom to insanity and beyond.\nThough Bellatrix was fanatically loyal to Voldemort, and believed that he was greater and more powerful than Dumbledore, she would not brave Dumbledore in a duel, as she recognised him as a far more superior wizard than she was a witch.\nDuring the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Bellatrix opted to flee rather than engage Dumbledore in battle, deflecting his spells as she made her escape, and was the only Death Eater in the Death Chamber who succeeded in escaping from him \u2014 a testament of her prodigious magical skills.\nWhile Bellatrix most likely never had so much as a full conversation with the Headmaster, Dumbledore seemed to understand her very well; he admitted to Severus Snape that he would prefer to not fall prey to Bellatrix Lestrange in his weakened state (caused by Voldemort's cursed Horcrux ring), as she liked to \" play with her food before she eats it \"; in other words, inflict unbelievable pain before finally delivering the killing blow.\nDeath Eaters\nA Death Eater, her allies\nBellatrix was not likely to have viewed many of the other Death Eaters as her equals, as she believed both her skill, devotion, and family status exceed that of others.\nUndoubtedly, she considered Voldemort's most loyal Death Eaters to be those who, like her, were imprisoned in Azkaban at some point: namely, Barty Crouch Jr, and her husband and his brother .\nWhile it's unclear exactly how much genuine respect the other Death Eaters had for Bellatrix, it was clear they were familiar with her view of herself, as Travers became less suspicious of Hermione Granger, disguised as Bellatrix via Polyjuice Potion in 1998, only after Hermione took on a much haughtier personality.\nBellatrix is notable for being one of the only female Death Eaters, this is exceptionally impressive since wizarding society as a whole seems fairly patriarchal.\nA desire to prove herself in a 'Man's World' could also lead to her obsessive overkill.\nHermione Granger\nHermione Granger, a hated enemy\nBellatrix tortured Hermione when the trio were caught by Snatchers and tried to get the truth out of her as to why the trio had Godric Gryffindor's sword and thought they had stole it from her vault.\nEven through this pressure, Hermione lied that it was a fake and Griphook helped get that across.\nIn the Battle of Hogwarts Bellatrix duelled Hermione, Ginny Weasley , and Luna Lovegood all at once.\nOrder of the Phoenix and enemies\nRon Weasley: \" No!\nYou can have me, keep me!\n\"Bellatrix Lestrange: \" If she dies under questioning, I'll take you next.\nBlood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book.\n\"\u2014 Bellatrix's prejudice and belief in blood supremacy  [src]Order of the Phoenix, her enemies\nMost of the Order of the Phoenix knew Bellatrix as one of the most dangerous and sadistic of Lord Voldemort's followers, especially considering Bellatrix managed to kill, seriously injure, or duel and successfully defeat several Order members.\nShe despised her \"blood traitor\" cousin and niece, Sirius Black and Nymphadora Tonks, both of whom she eventually murdered; she bested Kingsley Shacklebolt at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, was disgusted by Remus Lupin, as a werewolf, marrying into her family through Nymphadora Tonks, and of course, took part in torturing the Aurors Alice and Frank Longbottom .\nMolly Weasley, the witch who defeated Bellatrix\nAt the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, she singled out Hermione Granger, as a Muggle-born, to torture and interrogate, though she offered to take Ron Weasley next, as a member of the Weasley family, well known in pure-blood supremacist circles as \"blood traitors.\"\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts, Bellatrix cruelly taunted Molly Weasley about the death of Molly's son, Fred, and when she tried to attack Molly's daughter, Ginny, she instigated a vicious battle between Molly and herself.\nThis battle ended in the death of Bellatrix, who continued laughing derisively at the efforts of her opponent until the moment she realised Molly had defeated her.\nKreacher\nKreacher was the last house-elf of the House of Black, and he mimicked his family's pure-blood supremacist values.\nLike Sirius Black's mother, he was disappointed with Sirius for not sharing those same values.\nHe favoured Bellatrix and Narcissa, Sirius' two cousins.\nHe kept pictures of Bellatrix and some other Black family members in his sleeping area at 12 Grimmauld Place.\nHis picture of Bellatrix was his favourite, as he had attempted to repair it with Spellotape and placed it in front of the others.\nIn December of 1995, when Sirius yelled at Kreacher to \"get out\" of a room, Kreacher interpreted the words as a command to leave his master's service and exit the house altogether.\nBecause Bellatrix was currently in Azkaban and Andromeda had been disowned, Narcissa was the next family member whom he could serve.\nHe went to her home and gave her information about Harry's godson relationship with Sirius Black.\nLater, after Bellatrix escaped from Azkaban, he helped her by injuring Buckbeak, Sirius's hippogriff.\nHe also lied to Harry about Sirius being gone from the house one day, when he had actually only gone upstairs to tend to Buckbeak's injury.\nHarry went to the Ministry of Magic to \"save\" Sirius, who in turn went there to save Harry.\nAfter Bellatrix killed Sirius in a duel  [14], Kreacher hoped to officially move into her possession, but Sirius's will transferred ownership to Harry  [15].\nKreacher eventually gave his loyalty to Harry in 1997.\nHe fought against Voldemort and his Death Eaters, Bellatrix included, during the Battle of Hogwarts  [12] .\nMedia\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Bellatrix escapes from Azkaban (HD)Azkaban Breakout\nHarry Potter and

Hermione\nMolly Weasley vs Bellatrix Lestrange\nBellatrix's Final Duel\nFor more Harry Potter videos check out Wikia's video library\nEtymology\nLike many members of the House of Black, Bellatrix's name is derived from that of a star.\nBellatrix is the third brightest star in the constellation Orion; it is also known as the Amazon Star.\nThis is presumably an allusion to Bellatrix Lestrange being among the most dangerously skilled Death Eaters.\nThe Amazons were warrior women in Greek mythology.\nHer name likely has Latin, French and English origins: Bella is Latin both for the plural of bellum, meaning war, and the feminine singular adjective meaning \"beautiful;\" trix is Latin feminine suffix (i.e.\nBellatrix is the Latin word for a female warrior or a personification of feminine beauty).\n'Bellatrix' also translates directly to 'war-like', Lestrange is likely a play on l'\u00e9trange, which is French meaning \"the strange one\".\nHer name thus alludes to both her beauty and her mental instability, although technically Lestrange came from Bellatrix's husband Rodolphus.\nBehind the scenes\nBellatrix as a Lego mini-figure\nBellatrix as appears on Pottermore\nIn Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry witnesses her trial for the torture of Neville's parents in the pensieve.\nDespite this, she does not appear in the film adaptation, in which Barty Crouch Junior seems to be solely responsible for the crime (although Bellatrix's role in it is later revealed in the following film).\nOriginally, Helen Mc\nCrory was going to play the role of Bellatrix in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, but due to her pregnancy, she opted out of the film and was replaced by Helena Bonham Carter.\nIronically, Bonham Carter herself learned she was pregnant shortly after completing filming.\nMc\nCrory was eventually cast as Bellatrix's sister Narcissa in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\nIn the film, Bonham Carter is noticeably wearing looser clothing, as opposed to her form-fitting costume of the previous film (see below).\nWith Bonham Carter's casting, she is roughly the same age as Bellatrix during the books (early-mid 40s), but she is younger than all of the Marauders, whom she pre-dates in her Hogwarts education.\nIn the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Bonham Carter's costume reflected the mental state of the character, thus the torn gloves and dress.\nShe also had alternate attires with a hood worn up and a mask, but they were not used in the final cut of the film.\nOn the tapestry depicted in the film, the face of Bellatrix pictured is a face of Helena Bonham Carter.\nOn the DVD there is a different picture of Bellatrix on the tapestry, where she has a purple hat and looks stylistically similar to her sisters.\nThe house-elf Kreacher had a great fondness for Bellatrix.\nHarry Potter eventually came to understand that Kreacher responds to respect and kindness, and Hermione Granger realised that Bellatrix and Narcissa were indulgent with him, in contrast with Sirius' abuse.\nWhen they were kind to him, he gave them the information they wanted.\nBellatrix's most used spell is Crucio .\nShe is normally pictured on the right of Lord Voldemort, and most people on the right side of leaders, are thought as the most loyal follower of the leader.\nSirius Black told Harry Potter that Bellatrix ran in the same crowd as Severus Snape while at Hogwarts, but her date of birth makes this impossible.\nBellatrix would have attended Hogwarts from 1962 to 1969, or possibly 1963 to 1970, depending on which month in 1951 she was born in, whereas Snape began his schooling in 1971.\nThis may simply be an error, as J. K. Rowling has admitted that maths is not her strong suit.\n[20] Another possible explanation could be that both Bellatrix and Snape went around with the same type of people, some of whom may have overlapped depending on age.\nIt is is also possible that she failed her exams and had to repeat several Hogwarts years.\nBellatrix's wand is 12\u00be\" walnut wood, with a dragon heartstring core.\nIt was described by Garrick Ollivander as \"unyielding\".\n[21]Bellatrix escapes using the Floo Network\nHelena Bonham Carter, who portrays Bellatrix in the Harry Potter (film series), described the character as being \"as bonkers as they come\", commenting that Bellatrix has \"a bit of a child-like madness... like boys who like to pick apart an insect for the sake of it\".\n[22] .\nIn the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Bellatrix participates in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower but in the book there is no mention of her.\nAlso, a new scene was added of The Burrow being attacked and burned over the Christmas holidays by Bellatrix, Fenrir Greyback and an unknown Death Eater, possibly Amycus Carrow, Yaxley, or Thorfinn Rowle .\nJ. K. Rowling states in an interview that she had always intended that Molly Weasley would kill Bellatrix, for two main reasons: Firstly, so that Molly could \"have her moment [of victory]\" and show the doubting Bellatrix that simply because she dedicates herself to her family doesn't mean that she isn't a powerful witch.\nAnd second, to show the difference of Molly's romantic and maternal love against Bellatrix's obsessive 'love' of Voldemort.\n[19]In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Bellatrix appears in the adapted scene of the Battle of the Astronomy Tower despite there being no mention of her presence there in the sixth book.\nAlso of difference is the fact that there is no literal \"Battle\" between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix during this scene; allowing the former group to pass through Hogwarts without resistance and Bellatrix to walk insanely on the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall before casting a spell to destroy all of the Hall's many windows.\nIt is during the segment in the Astronomy Tower that Bellatrix speaks the line, \"well done\", to Draco for cornering Dumbledore.\nIn the book, it is Amycus Carrow who congratulates Draco for his work.\nBellatrix then proceeds to order Draco to hurry and murder Dumbledore, in place of Yaxley  (who does not make a true appearance at all in the film).\nAlso different in this section of the film is that Bellatrix casts the Dark Mark into the sky after Dumbledore's death, whereas in the book, it is Gibbon who does so prior to the death of the Headmaster.\nFinally, Bellatrix (in the film) is shown to commit acts that were Thorfinn Rowle 's doing in the book.\nThese include burning down Hagrid's hut  (although the film shows the burning process to be more explosive than it was described to be in the book) and briefly torturing Harry with the Cruciatus Curse .\nBellatrix's wanted poster is featured on an official Warner Brothers Harry Potter t-shirt.\nIt says that Bellatrix was convicted for murder.\nIn the book, she was sentenced to Azkaban for her participation in the torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom.\nBellatrix has the distinction of being the only person in the series to duel all three main characters on separate occasions.\nShe attacked Harry Potter during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, fought Ron Weasley in the sky during the Battle of the Seven Potters and duelled with Hermione Granger in the Battle of Hogwarts .\nIn the special features of the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, J.\nK Rowling describes Bellatrix as 'the female Death Eater par excellence'.\nBellatrix, like her two younger sisters, Andromeda and Narcissa, only had a single child.\nBellatrix is the only Black sister to have a child out of wedlock.\nIt's likely that it was Bellatrix who picked the name for her daughter from Lord Voldemort, as Delphini follows the tradition of the House of Black to name its members after stars and celestial bodies.\nIt's also likely that if it was indeed Bellatrix's choice, Voldemort could have approved it as it was a pure-blood name which complied with traditions of high-born pure-blood noble family.\nIn the final book and film, Molly Weasley is the one who kills Bellatrix.\nHowever, in the final video game, after Neville defies Voldemort and pulls the sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat, Voldemort casts a Killing Curse at Neville and it ricochets off of the sword and hits Bellatrix, she does not die when it hits her, but screams when it does.\nShe later fights Molly and is defeated, lying on the floor dead, unlike the movie when she's blasted into ash.\nThe script for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince describes Bellatrix as a \"mad child.\n\"In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Bellatrix does not question Snape about his loyalties nor does she show any signs of disagreement or hatred towards Snape.\nHowever, she does sneer at him and taunt him for being a coward as well as tell her sister that \"He can't be trusted\" to which Narcissa responds \"The Dark Lord trusts him\".\nFor the release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince movie, Popco had introduced several \"series\" of Harry Potter movie action figures, including Bellatrix, in the United Kingdom and several other European countries.\nThis made people in the United States go online to buy this action figure and/or others via British departments of certain online shopping websites.\nThese websites include Amazon UK and Ebay UK.\nBellatrix may have been a classmate of Rita Skeeter as both women were born in the same year (1951).\nIn an interview, Helena Bonham Carter mentions that the scene where she holds Neville with her wand to his throat contains an injury.\nShe ad-libbed pushing her wand into his ear canal, thinking it was good torture.\nUnfortunately Neville moved his head towards her and ruptured his ear drum.\nShe didn't learn until later that she did it, and regrets it because Matthew Lewis \"Is such a nice young man.\n\"Bellatrix appears as something of a mini-boss in the Harry Potter Adventure World of LEGO Dimensions.\nShe can be fought if the player knocks on the door to Grimmauld Place, then after battling five to fifteen Death Eaters she must be hit three times with an object using the levitation charm.\nIn LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, Bellatrix kills Dobby launching him various objects (like a fish or a lamp) which caused their death crushing him instead than launching him a knife.\nAlso, her death is very different.\nAfter fighting Molly Weasley and Kingsley Shacklebolt, Bellatrix's corpse separates in three pieces (her head, her torso, and her legs) and later explodes, killing her in the process.\nAppearances\nThe Harry Potter Wiki has 293 images related to Bellatrix Lestrange.\nBellatrix's Death Eater Mask\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  (First appearance)  (Appears in

Cox was appointed postmaster of Indianola, becoming the first black female postmaster in the United States.\nHer rank was raised from fourth class to third class in 1900, and she was appointed to a full four-year term.\nCox's position was one of the most respected and lucrative public posts in Indianola, as it served approximately 3,000 patrons and paid $1,100 annually\u2014a large sum at that time.\nWhite resentment to Cox's prestigious position began to grow, and in 1902 some white residents in Indianola drew up a petition requesting Cox's resignation.\nJames K. Vardaman, editor of The Greenwood Commonwealth and a white supremacist, began delivering speeches reproaching the people of Indianola for \"tolerating a negro [sic] wench as a postmaster.\"  [3] Racial tensions grew, and threats of physical harm led Cox to submit her resignation to take effect on January 1, 1903.\nThe incident attracted national attention, and President Roosevelt refused to accept her resignation, feeling Cox had been wronged, and the authority of the federal government was being compromised.\n\"Roosevelt stood resolute.\nUnless Cox's detractors could prove a reason for her dismissal other than the color of her skin, she would remain the Indianola postmistress\".\n[4] Roosevelt closed Indianola's post office on January 2, 1903, and rerouted mail to Greenville; Cox continued to receive her salary.\nThat same month, the United States Senate debated the Indianola postal event for four hours, and Cox left Indianola for her own safety and did not return.\nIn February 1904, the post office was reopened, but demoted in rank from third class to fourth class.\n[5]In the early and mid-twentieth century a number of Blues musicians originated in the area, including B.\nB.\nKing, who worked in the local cotton industry in Indianola in the 1940s before pursuing a professional musical career.\nIn July 1954, two months after the Supreme Court of the United States announced its unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education, ruling that school segregation was unconstitutional, the local plantation manager Robert B. Patterson met with a group of like-minded individuals in a private home in Indianola to form the White Citizens' Council.\n[6] Its goal was to resist any implementation of racial integration in Mississippi.\nThe Indianola Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\nGeography  [ edit]Indianola is located at the junction of U.\nS. Routes 82 and 49W.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.7 square miles (23 km 2 ), of which 8.6 square miles (22 km 2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km 2) (1.03%) is water, including Indian Bayou, which runs the length of the city and beyond.\nIndianola is 30 miles (48 km) from Greenwood.\n[7]The topography of Indianola is flat, with the only significant elevation changes along waterways such as Indian Bayou and one Indian mound located on Main Street east of U.\nS. 49.\n[ citation needed]Demographics  [ edit]Historical population\nCensus Pop.\n%\u00b11890 249 \u20141900 630 153.0%1910 1,098 74.3%1920 2,112 92.3%1930 3,116 47.5%1940 3,604 15.7%1950 4,369 21.2%1960 6,714 53.7%1970 8,947 33.3%1980 8,050 \u221210.0%1990 11,809 46.7%2000 12,066 2.2%2010 10,683 \u221211.5%Est.\n2016 9,655  [1] \u22129.6%U.\nS. Decennial Census  [8]As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 10,683 people residing in the city.\nThe racial makeup of the city was 78.8% African American , 18.5% White , 0.2% Native American, 0.5% Asian, <0.1% from some other race and 0.4% from two or more races.\n1.6% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nAs of the census  [9] of 2000, there were 12,066 people, 3,899 households, and 2,982 families residing in the city.\nThe population density was 1,400.3 people per square mile (540.5/km\u00b2).\nThere were 4,118 housing units at an average density of 477.9 per square mile (184.5/km\u00b2).\nThe racial makeup of the city was 25.73% White, 73.38% African American, 0.01% Native American, 0.46% Asian American, 0.16% from other races, and 0.27% from two or more races.\nHispanic or Latino of any race were 0.71% of the population.\nThere were 3,899 households out of which 39.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.8% were married couples living together, 31.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.5% were non-families.\n20.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.\nThe average household size was 3.05 and the average family size was 3.5.\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 32.9% under the age of 18, 11.5% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 18.4% from 45 to 64, and 10.6% who were 65 years of age or older.\nThe median age was 30 years.\nFor every 100 females there were 83.0 males.\nFor every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.3 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $26,308, and the median income for a family was $31,186.\nMales had a median income of $27,310 versus $17,622 for females.\nThe per capita income for the city was $12,082.\nAbout 22.5% of families and 27.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 35.8% of those under age 18 and 21.5% of those age 65 or over.\nEconomy  [ edit]Because Indianola is located at the intersection of U.\nS. Route 49W and U.\nS. Route 82, as of 2004 it is one of the last economically viable small towns in the Mississippi Delta.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s the city government convinced a major retailer to build a distribution center near the intersection of the two highways.\nThis development infused cash into the local economy and allowed semiskilled jobs to be established.\n[10]In August 2011, Delta Pride, a catfish processing company, closed its plant in Indianola.\n[11]Culture  [ edit]Club Ebony in Indianola\nB.\nB.\nKing Museum and Delta Interpretive Center\nJ. Todd Moye, author of Let the People Decide: Black Freedom and White Resistance Movements in Sunflower County, Mississippi, 1945\u20131986, said that \"Life in Indianola still moves at a pace established by its distinguishing characteristic, the picturesque and languid Indian Bayou that winds through downtown.\"\n[10]The blues  [ edit]It is the birthplace of the blues musician Albert King.\nThe blues harp player, Little Arthur Duncan, was born in Indianola in 1934.\n[12] Henry Sloan lived in Indianola, and Charley Patton died near the city.\nB.\nB.\nKing grew up in Indianola as a child.\nHe came to the blues festival named for him every year.\nKing referenced the city with the title of his 1970 album Indianola Mississippi Seeds.\nThe B.\nB.\nKing Museum and Delta Interpretive Center, a $14 million facility dedicated to King and the blues, opened in September 2008.\n[13] Many street names are named after King and his music, including B.\nB.\nKing Road, Lucille St. (named after his guitar), and Delta Blues St.\nEducation  [ edit]The Sunflower County Consolidated School District, headquartered in Indianola, operates public schools serving the city.\nResidents are zoned to Lockard Elementary School (K-2), Carver Elementary School (3-6), Robert L. Merritt Junior High School (7-9), and Gentry High School  (10-12).\nThe district operates two other 10-12 schools, Indianola Career and Technical Center and Indianola Academic Achievement Academy.\n[14] Previously the facilities were in the Indianola School District.\nIndianola Academy, a private school and former segregation academy, is in Indianola.\nAs of 2012 most white teenagers in Indianola attend Indianola Academy instead of the public high schools.\nSarah Carr of The Atlantic explained that there are two explanations of why the private academies in Indianola and other towns still exist.\nOne says that the public schools suffered from poor leadership and wrongdoing and that the private academies thrive because of the failings of the public schools, and the other says that the white leadership starved the public schools of resources after the academies were enacted, leading to the failings of the public schools.\n[15] There is one other private school, Restoration Ministries Christian Academy.\nThe Sunflower County Library operates the Henry M. Seymour Library in Indianola, which houses its administrative headquarters.\n[16]History of education  [ edit]Prior to the school district merger, the Sunflower County School District had its headquarters in the Sunflower County Courthouse in Indianola.\n[17]  [18] The district's educational services building is along U.\nS. Route 49 West in Indianola.\n[19]As of 1996, 90 per cent of students in the Indianola School District were black.\nMost of the white students who attended Indianola public schools transferred to private schools by junior high school.\n[20]Government and infrastructure  [ edit]Indianola Post Office\nThe Mississippi Department of Corrections operates a probation and parole office in the Courthouse Annex in Indianola.\n[21]The United States Postal Service operates the Indianola Post Office.\n[22] A mural, entitled White Gold in the Delta by WPA Section of Painting and Sculpture artist Beulah Bettersworth, was installed in the post office in 1939.\nIt depicted cotton harvesting scenes.\nMurals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the U.\nS. Treasury Department.\nThe original artist Walter Anderson was unable to complete the mural, and Bettersworth was selected.\nThe mural was eventually destroyed.\nIn 2008, the building was named the Minnie Cox Post Office Building by an act of Congress.\n[23]Transportation  [ edit]Indianola Municipal Airport is located in unincorporated Sunflower County, near Indianola.\n[24] is operated by the city.\n[25]Notable people  [ edit]Mary Alice, actress.\nCoolidge Ball, first African-American athlete at Ole Miss.\nCraig Claiborne, New York Times culinary writer.\nWilliam Harold Cox, federal district court judge.\nLittle Arthur Duncan, blues musician.\nJazz Gillum, blues musician.\nBill L.

bruising after a severe fall.\nA contusion, commonly known as a bruise, is a type of hematoma of tissue  [1] in which capillaries and sometimes venules are damaged by trauma, allowing blood to seep, hemorrhage, or extravasate into the surrounding interstitial tissues.\nThe bruise then remains visible until the blood is either absorbed by tissues or cleared by immune system action.\nBruises, which do not blanch under pressure, can involve capillaries at the level of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone.\n[2]  [3] Bruises are not to be confused with other similar-looking lesions primarily distinguished by their diameter or causation.\n[ clarification needed] These lesions include petechia  (< 3 mm result from numerous and diverse etiologies such as adverse reactions from medications such as warfarin, straining, asphyxiation, platelet disorders and diseases such as cytomegalovirus),  [4] purpura  (3 mm to 1 cm, classified as palpable purpura or non-palpable purpura and indicates various pathologic conditions such as thrombocytopenia),  [5] and ecchymosis  (>1 cm caused by blood dissecting through tissue planes and settled in an area remote from the site of trauma or pathology such as periorbital ecchymosis, e.g.,\"raccoon eyes\", arising from a basilar skull fracture or from a neuroblastoma).\n[6]As a type of hematoma, a bruise is always caused by internal bleeding into the interstitial tissues which does not break through the skin, usually initiated by blunt trauma, which causes damage through physical compression and deceleration forces.\nTrauma sufficient to cause bruising can occur from a wide variety of situations including accidents, falls, and surgeries.\nDisease states such as insufficient or malfunctioning platelets, other coagulation deficiencies, or vascular disorders, such as venous blockage associated with severe allergies  [7] can lead to the formation of purpura which is not to be confused with trauma-related bruising/contusion.\n[8] If the trauma is sufficient to break the skin and allow blood to escape the interstitial tissues, the injury is not a bruise but instead a different variety of hemorrhage called bleeding.\nHowever, such injuries may be accompanied by bruising elsewhere.\n[9]Bruises often induce pain, but small bruises are not normally dangerous alone.\nSometimes bruises can be serious, leading to other more life-threatening forms of hematoma, such as when associated with serious injuries, including fractures and more severe internal bleeding.\nThe likelihood and severity of bruising depends on many factors, including type and healthiness of affected tissues.\nMinor bruises may be easily recognized in people with light skin color by characteristic blue or purple appearance (idiomatically described as \"black and blue\") in the days following the injury.\nContents [ hide ]1 Cause1.1 Size and shape1.2 Severity2 Mechanism3 Treatment4 History5 See also6 Notes7 External links\nCause  [ edit]The presence of bruises may be seen in patients with platelet or coagulation disorders, or those who are being treated with an anticoagulant.\nUnexplained bruising may be a warning sign of child abuse, domestic abuse, or serious medical problems such as leukemia or meningoccocal infection.\nUnexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer.\nLong-term glucocorticoid therapy can cause easy bruising.\nBruising present around the navel  (belly button) with severe abdominal pain suggests acute pancreatitis.\nConnective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may cause relatively easy or spontaneous bruising depending on the severity.\nDuring an autopsy, bruises accompanying abrasions indicate the abrasions occurred while the individual was alive, as opposed to damage incurred post mortem.\n[ citation needed]Size and shape  [ edit]Bruise shapes may correspond directly to the instrument of injury or be modified by additional factors.\nBruises often become more prominent as time lapses, resulting in additional size and swelling, and may grow to a large size over the course of the hours after the injury that caused the bruise was inflicted.\nAs stated above, bruising present in a different location than the site of impact is called ecchymosis and generally occurs when the tissue at the site of injury is loose, allowing blood to travel under the skin to another location due to gravity or other forces, such as in a black eye.\nBruise caused by a handrail, typical of extreme sports\nBruise caused by a sprained ankle\nBlack eye and subconjunctival hemorrhage after a punch to the face\nCondition and type of tissue: In soft tissues, a larger area is bruised than would be in firmer tissue due to ease of blood to invade tissue.\nAge: elderly skin and other tissues are often thinner and less elastic and thus more prone to bruising.\nGender: More bruising occurs in females due to increased subcutaneous fat.\nSkin tone: Discoloration caused by bruises is more prominent in lighter complexions.\nDiseases: Coagulation, platelet and blood vessel diseases or deficiencies can increase bruising due to more bleeding.\nLocation: More extensive vascularity causes more bleeding.\nAreas such as the arms, knees, shins and the facial area are especially common bruise sites.\nForces: Greater striking forces cause greater bruising.\nGenes: Despite having completely normal coagulation factors, natural redheads have been shown to bruise more, although this may just be due to greater visibility on commonly associated lighter complexion.\n[10]Severity  [ edit]Bruises can be scored on a scale from 0-5 to categorize the severity and danger of the injury.\n[ citation needed]Bruise harm score\nHarm score Severity level Notes0 Light bruise No damage1 Mild bruise Little damage2 Moderate bruise Some damage3 Serious bruise Dangerous4 Extremely serious bruise Dangerous5 Critical bruise Risk of death\nThe harm score is determined by the extent and severity of the fractures to the organs and tissues causing the bruising, in turn depending on multiple factors.\nFor example, a contracted muscle will bruise more severely, as will tissues crushed against underlying bone.\nCapillaries vary in strength, stiffness and toughness, which can also vary by age and medical conditions.\nAn alternate bruise severity ranking system called the Chien Intensity Scale is slowly growing in popularity in some research circles.\nAlthough not widely used, the Chien Intensity Scale is used by institutes including the Ryan Mackey Memorial Research Institute and the Sydney Medical Center.\n[ citation needed]Low levels of damaging forces produce small bruises and generally cause the individual to feel minor pain straight away.\nRepeated impacts worsen bruises, increasing the harm level.\nNormally, light bruises heal nearly completely within two weeks, although duration is affected by variation in severity and individual healing processes;  [11] generally, more severe or deeper bruises take somewhat longer.\nSevere bruising (harm score 2-3) may be dangerous or cause serious complications.\nFurther bleeding and excess fluid may accumulate causing a hard, fluctuating lump or swelling hematoma.\nThis has the potential to cause compartment syndrome as the swelling cuts off blood flow to the tissues.\nThe trauma that induced the bruise may also have caused other severe and potentially fatal harm to internal organs.\nFor example, impacts to the head can cause traumatic brain injury: bleeding, bruising and massive swelling of the brain with the potential to cause concussion, coma and death.\nTreatment for brain bruising may involve emergency surgery to relieve the pressure on the brain.\nDamage that causes bruising can also cause bones to be broken, tendons or muscles to be strained, ligaments to be sprained, or other tissue to be damaged.\nThe symptoms and signs of these injuries may initially appear to be those of simple bruising.\nAbdominal bruising or severe injuries that cause difficulty in moving a limb or the feeling of liquid under the skin may indicate life-threatening injury and require the attention of a physician.\nMechanism  [ edit]Severe bruising resulting from yard work injury\nIncreased distress to tissue causes capillaries to break under the skin, allowing blood to escape and build up.\nAs time progresses, blood seeps into the surrounding tissues, causing the bruise to darken and spread.\nNerve endings within the affected tissue detect the increased pressure, which, depending on severity and location, may be perceived as pain or pressure or be asymptomatic.\nThe damaged capillary endothelium releases endothelin, a hormone that causes narrowing of the blood vessel to minimize bleeding.\nAs the endothelium is destroyed, the underlying von Willebrand factor is exposed and initiates coagulation, which creates a temporary clot to plug the wound and eventually leads to restoration of normal tissue.\nDuring this time, larger bruises may change color due to the breakdown of hemoglobin from within escaped red blood cells in the extracellular space.\nThe striking colors of a bruise are caused by the phagocytosis and sequential degradation of hemoglobin to biliverdin to bilirubin to hemosiderin, with hemoglobin itself producing a red-blue color, biliverdin producing a green color, bilirubin producing a yellow color, and hemosiderin producing a golden-brown color.\n[9] As these products are cleared from the area, the bruise disappears.\nOften the underlying tissue damage has been repaired long before this process is complete.\nTreatment  [ edit]Healing of a black eye over a 9-day period caused by a wisdom tooth extraction\nTreatment for light bruises is minimal and may include RICE  (rest, ice, compression, elevation), painkillers  (particularly NSAIDs) and, later in recovery, light stretching exercises.\nParticularly, immediate application of ice while elevating the area may reduce or completely prevent swelling by restricting blood flow to the area and preventing internal bleeding.\nRest and preventing re-injury is essential for rapid recovery.\nApplying a medicated cream containing mucopolysaccharide polysulfuric acid (e.g., Hirudoid) may also speed the healing process.\n[ citation needed] Other topical creams containing skin-fortifying ingredients, including but not limited to retinol or alpha hydroxy acids, such as Der\nMend, can improve the appearance of bruising faster than if left to heal on its own.\n[ citation needed]Very gently massaging the area and applying heat may encourage blood flow and relieve pain according to the gate control theory of pain, although causing additional pain may indicate the massage is exacerbating the injury.\n[12] As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until at least three days following the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped, because although increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into the area and encourage drainage, if the injury is still bleeding this will allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse.\nIn most cases hematomas spontaneously revert, but in cases of large hematomas or those localized in certain organs ( e.g., the brain), the physician may optionally perform a puncture of the hematoma to allow the blood to exit.\n[13]History  [ edit]Folk medicine, including ancient medicine of Egyptians, Greeks, Celts, Turks, Slavs, Mayans, Aztecs and Chinese, has used bruising as a treatment for some health problems.\nThe methods vary widely and include cupping, scraping, and slapping.\nFire cupping uses suction which causes bruising in patients.\nScraping ( Gua Sha) uses a small hand device with a rounded edge to gently scrape the scalp or the skin.\nAnother ancient device that creates mild bruising is a strigil, used by Greeks and Romans in the bath.\nArchaeologically there is no precedent for scraping tools before Greek archaeological evidence, not Chinese or Egyptian.\n[14]See also  [ edit]Blunt trauma\nBlack eye\nBlister\nBurn\nCerebral contusion \u2014 bruising of brain tissue\nLove-bite \u2014 bruising created by excessive suction of a particular area

    "document": "When Should a Baby Stand? Babies Growth & Development\nWhen Should a Baby Stand?\nBy Vincent Iannelli, MD, a board-certified physician\nUpdated February 06, 2018Share Pin Email\nPrint\nWhen did your baby learn to stand?.\nBlend Images - Roberto Westbrook/Brand X Pictures/Getty Images\nPulling up and standing are fun and exciting milestones for babies.\nStanding is usually a prelude to cruising and walking and means that your baby is about to become a lot more mobile.\nAccording to the Denver II Developmental Assessment milestone's chart, infants can usually:\nStand, holding on to things between 6 1/2 to 8 1/2 months\nPull to a standing position between 8 to 10 months\nStand for about 2 seconds between 9 to 11 1/2 months\nStand alone between 10 1/2 to 14 months\nThat isn't the range when all infants meet these milestones, though.\nIt is simply when 25-90% of infants could stand, holding on or stand alone, etc.\nSo, about 10% of toddlers could take a little longer and eventually meet the milestone a few weeks or months later.\nDevelopmental Delays in Standing\nWhy isn't your baby standing yet?\nEspecially if your child met most other developmental milestones a little later than usual, but did eventually catch up, then he just may need more time with this one too.\nSome medical conditions that might cause a delay in standing or walking might include:\nCerebral palsy\nCongenital orthopedic problems\nDown syndrome\nMuscular dystrophy\nBy 18 months, your pediatrician should make sure that your toddler can \"sit, stand, and walk independently.\n\"What to Know About Standing\nIn addition to these tips, other things to know about standing include that:\nMost younger infants are able to stand up with support and bear weight on their legs between 2 and 4 1/2 months, and no, it won't cause them to have bow-legs.\nMost toddlers can walk backward between 13 and 17 months.\nMost toddlers begin running and walking up steps at 14 months.\nToddlers with undiagnosed developmental hip dysplasia can probably stand and will likely learn to walk with a limp or waddling gait.\nTalk to your pediatricians or consider a referral to ECI or a developmental specialist if you have concerns that your baby isn't standing on time or is a late walker.\nSources:\nAAP Clinical Report.\nMotor Delays: Early Identification and Evaluation.\nPediatrics 2013;131:e2016\u2013e2027.\n\n",

    "document": "Can a neurologist specialize in treating sciatic nerve pain? Can a neurologist specialize in treating sciatic nerve pain?\nIf you are researching sciatica specialists to treat your nerve pain, you might want to explore the credentials of several neurologists.\nNeurologists are physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders and conditions of the nervous system, including the sciatic nerve.\nAs the largest nerve in the body, the sciatic nerve runs from the base of the spinal cord through the buttocks and down the back of the leg.\nIf this nerve becomes pinched or compressed, sciatica can develop.\nSciatica is a group of symptoms characterized by pain in the lower back and shooting pain, numbness, weakness, cramping, spasms and tingling down one or both legs and into the feet.\nAlthough, in most cases, sciatica affects only one side of the body.\nRead on to learn about the education requirement sciatica specialists undergo as well as common recommendations you might receive for sciatic nerve pain.\nEducation for sciatica specialists\nEducational requirements for neurologists specializing in sciatica include:\nFour years of premedical undergraduate studies at a college or university\nFour years of medical school\nOne year of an internship\nThree or more years of specialty training in a hospital-based residency program\nWhen you are trying to locate a sciatica specialist, be sure to research the educational qualifications of neurologists and confirm that they are board-certified or board-eligible and belong to a professional society, such as the American Neurological Association.\nMinimally invasive sciatica procedures\nYou might find that visiting a neurologist to treat your sciatica can be helpful.\nMost sciatica specialists typically recommend a course of conservative treatments at first.\nIn most cases, nonsurgical treatments including anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, chiropractic visits and steroid injections can alleviate pain.\nIn some people, however, sciatica symptoms might not improve and surgery could be recommended by a sciatica specialist.\nBefore you consent to any surgical procedure, you should consider seeing if you are a candidate for the minimally invasive procedures performed by the orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons at Laser Spine Institute.\nAt Laser Spine Institute, we offer minimally invasive decompression and stabilization surgery in order to create space in the spinal canal and relieve your sciatic nerve pain.\nOur minimally invasive spine surgery offers several advantages over traditional open neck or back surgery, including no lengthy recovery, a patient satisfaction score of 96 and a patient recommendation score of 97 out of 100.^Through the use of advanced techniques, our surgeons have helped more than 75,000 patients find relief from chronic neck and back pain.\nContact Laser Spine Institute to learn more about how our procedures can address sciatica and receive a no-cost MRI review.\n*\n\n",

can change her life.\n'\"\u2014Nicki Minaj\nNicki Minaj Biography\nRapper  (1982\u2013)469SHARESHip-hop artist Nicki Minaj rocketed to fame with tracks like \"Super Bass,\" \"Starships,\" and later \"Anaconda.\"\nShe is the first female solo artist to have seven singles simultaneously on the Billboard 100 chart.\nSynopsis\nShe may be diminutive, but Nicki Minaj packs a lot of talent into her 5-foot 2-inch frame.\nBorn in the Caribbean, she moved to New York as a five-year-old and has overcome a difficult childhood to become one of the most successful rap artists of this or any other generation.\nMinaj has also branched out into television and film, in demand for her colorful bubblegum persona and image.\nShe's active on social media and in fashion and has launched several fragrances.\nHer label-mate Lil Wayne calls her \"an icon\" who has \"reached far beyond anything I would have imagined.\nNicki will go down as one of the best to do it in the history of music.\"Tough Childhood in Queens, NYThe rapper and singer Nicki Minaj was born Onika Tanya Maraj on December 8, 1982, in Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago, and moved with her family to Queens, New York, when she was five years old.\nMinaj's father was a severe drug addict with a long history of violence.\nAt one point, he set fire to the family's home in a failed attempt to kill Minaj's mother.\nThose early struggles, Minaj has said, helped fuel her drive to rise above the life her parents knew.\n\"I've always had this female-empowerment thing in the back of my mind,\" she told Details magazine, \"because I wanted my mother to be stronger, and she couldn't be.\nI thought, 'If I'm successful, I can change her life.\n'\"Advertisement\nVisit Site\nTo reach that point, the young Minaj developed personas for herself that would allow her to reinvent herself.\nAn early incarnation was \"Cookie,\" then came \"Harajuku Barbie\" before finally settling on Nicki Minaj.\n\"Fantasy was my reality,\" she has said.\nMinaj clearly had a knack for performance.\nAt the age of 12, she authored her first rap, then went on to delve into acting at La\nGuardia High School of Music and Art, the school that inspired the movie Fame.\nBut her acting career didn't take off, and she took up a range of steady jobs, including waitressing at Red Lobster, where she was fired for being rude to customers.\nMixtapes Make Way for Young Money Deal\nDetermined to make it in the music business, Minaj took on backup singing roles for local New York City rappers, including Full Force.\nSoon, she began writing her own material.\nShe was eventually discovered by the Dirty Money CEO Fendi, who came across Minaj's My\nSpace page, loved what he heard, and signed her to his label.\nThat connection led Minaj to Lil Wayne, who collaborated with her on a series of mixtapes, the first of which, Playtime Is Over, was released in April 2007.\nThis and subsequent mixtapes, including Sucka Free  (2008) and Beam Me Up Scotty  (2009), showcased Minaj's female swagger and out-front style.\nShe signed to Lil Wayne's Young Money label in August, 2009, becoming its first ever female artist.\nShe solidified her growing rep with appearances on the We Are Young Money compilation album (2009), also collaborating with Mariah Carey and Robin Thicke.\nBy early 2010, anticipation had built up around Minaj's debut album, which was scheduled for release that fall.\nIn April of that year, she released her first single, \"Massive Attack,\" followed by \"Your Love.\"\nTwo months later she won Best Hip Hop Female at the annual BET Awards.\nShe dedicated the award to Lil Wayne.\nThe Pink Friday album dropped that November, with eight singles released to promote it.\nIt went triple platinum, and received generally positive reviews.\nEntertainment Weekly's Brad Wete was reminded of \"her labelmate Drake \u2014 fully aware of how amazing she is, but also how fragile.\" Minaj displayed a range of alter-egos on her releases, including Onika, Nicki Lewinsky and Roman Zolanski.\n'American Idol' Feud With Mariah Carey\nIn March 2012, Minaj made a guest appearance on the popular television competition American Idol.\nShe told singer Jennifer Lopez, then a judge on the show, to \"scoot over a little bit\" to make room for her at the judges' table.\nRumors then flew of a feud between Minaj and Lopez, which Minaj later dismissed.\nLater that year, however, Minaj apparently got her wish when she was announced as a judge on American Idol.\nIt didn't take long before the fireworks began between her and fellow judge Mariah Carey.\nThe pair seemed to take an instant dislike to each other, and openly feuded during the show's early auditions.\nTelevision viewers got to see the two square off once the show's 12th season began airing in early 2013.\nMinaj and Carey got into an argument during auditions in Charlotte, North Carolina, with Minaj storming off stage.\nCarey later claimed that Minaj threatened her with physical harm and decided to hire extra security as a result, according to the New York Daily News.\nMinaj has also been critical of the show, tweeting that American Idol \"is NOT a singing competition.\n\"Claiming the Crown, Other Projects\nMinaj reached a national audience with her 2012 Super Bowl appearance.\nShe performed alongside Madonna in the game's popular halftime show.\nA short time later, Minaj released the album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded.\nThe record proved to be a smash hit, reaching the top of the pop, R&B and rap charts.\nThe infectious dance song \"Starships\" was the first breakout single.\n\"Pound the Alarm\" soon followed, and as did \"Va Va Voom.\"\nShe went on to perform \"Roman Holiday\" at the Grammy Awards the same year.\nEight more singles were released from her next album, The Pinkprint, which came out on December 12, 2014.\nThe album's star-studded guest list included Beyonc\u00e9, Chris Brown, Ariana Grande and Drake.\nIt went double platinum, and in 2016, she won the Best Female Hip Hop Artist award at the BET Awards for the seventh consecutive time.\nMinaj had also been branching out into other areas.\nShe provided the voice of mammoth Steffie in 2012's Ice Age: Continental Drift and made her movie debut in 2014's The Other Woman, opposite Cameron Diaz.\nShe later received a Teen Choice Awards 2016 nomination for her role in Barbershop: The Next Cut.\nShe has fronted a number of endorsement deals and advertising campaigns, including MAC Cosmetics, Adidas Originals and Pepsi, and has her own fragrance line.\nShe is a shareholder in the Tidal streaming service.\nHer relationship with the rapper Meek Mill ended in early 2017.\nDespite all her other projects, Minaj hasn't lost her musical focus \u2014 she's already recording music for her next album, and is currently engaged in a war of words with the fellow female rapper Remy Ma.\nWhile the latter has just released a stinging diss track called \"Shether,\" she has a long way to go to dethrone the current queen of hip hop.\n(Profile photo of Nicki Minaj by Kevin Mazur/AMA2015/Wire\nImage)Related Videos\nJustin Bieber - Mini

    "document": "Overview Overview\nAn anal, or rectal, abscess occurs when a cavity in the anus becomes filled with pus.\nIt causes extreme pain, fatigue, rectal discharge, and fever.\nIn some cases, anal abscesses can result in painful anal fistulas.\nThis occurs when the abscess doesn't heal and breaks open on the surface of the skin.\nIf an anal abscess doesn't heal, it can cause a lot of pain and may require surgery.\nCauses and risks\nWhat causes an anal abscess?\nWho is at risk?\nA blocked anal gland, a sexually transmitted infection (STI), or an infected anal fissure can cause anal abscesses.\nSome other risk factors include:\nCrohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, which are inflammatory bowel diseases that cause the body to attack healthy tissuediabetesa compromised immune system due to illnesses like HIV or AIDSanal sex, which can increase the risk of anal abscesses in both men and womenuse of the medication prednisone or other steroidscurrent or recent chemotherapyconstipationdiarrhea\nToddlers or children that have a history of anal fissures (tears in the anal sphincter) are also at a higher risk for developing anal abscesses later on.\nSuch anal fissures might occur in children who have a history of constipation.\nSymptoms\nWhat are the symptoms of an anal abscess?\nThrobbing and constant pain in the anal area is probably one of the most common and immediately noticeable symptoms of anal abscess.\nThe pain is usually accompanied by swelling in the anal area and greater pain during bowel movements.\nOther common signs of an anal abscess include:constipationrectal discharge or bleedingswelling or tenderness of the skin surrounding the anusfatigue\nSome people may be able to feel a nodule or lump that's red, swollen, and tender at the rim of the anus.\nFever and chills can result from the infection.\nYou may also have rectal bleeding or urinary symptoms such as difficulty urinating.\nAnal abscesses may also occur deeper in the rectum, most often in those who have inflammatory bowel diseases.\nThis can result in some pain or discomfort in the abdominal area.\nIn toddlers, there typically aren't many symptoms other than signs of discomfort or pain, which may cause a child to become irritable.\nA lump or nodule may also be visible or felt around the anal area.\nDiagnosis\nHow is an anal abscess diagnosed?\nAnal abscesses are most often diagnosed through a physical exam where your doctor checks the area for characteristic nodules.\nYou doctor will also check for pain, redness, and swelling in the anal area.\nIn some people, there may not be any visible signs of the abscess on the surface of the skin around their anus.\nYou doctor will instead use an instrument called an endoscope to look inside the anal canal and lower rectum.\nSometimes the abscess may be deeper than a physical exam can find.\nThen, you doctor may order an MRI or ultrasound to get a better look.\nFurther tests may be necessary to make sure Crohn's disease isn't a contributing factor.\nIn these cases, a blood test, imaging, and a colonoscopy may be required.\nDuring a colonoscopy, your doctor will use a lighted, flexible scope to examine your colon.\nTreatment\nTreatment options for an anal abscess\nAnal abscesses rarely go away without treatment.\nThe most common and simple treatment is for your doctor to drain the pus from the infected area.\nThis can usually be done in the doctor's office.\nYour doctor will use medicine to numb the area.\nAny uncomfortable pressure should be relieved, allowing the tissue to begin to heal properly.\nIf anal abscesses are left untreated, they turn into painful anal fistulas that may require more surgical treatment.\nAccording to the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), about 50 percent of people who have an anal abscess will eventually develop an anal fistula.\nA fistula is an abnormal opening in the skin near the anus.\nA fistula generally requires surgery to fix the problem.\nIf there's an extremely large anal abscess, surgery may be required.\nIn some cases, a catheter may be used to make sure the abscess drains completely.\nAbscesses that have been drained are typically left open and don't require stitches.\nIf you have diabetes or a compromised immune system, your doctor may ask you to stay in the hospital for a few days to watch for any infection.\nAfter surgery, it's recommended you take warm (not hot) baths.\nSitting in warm water will help reduce swelling and allow for more drainage the abscess.\nYour doctor may also prescribe antibiotics if you have a compromised immune system or if the infection has spread.\nPrevention\nWays to prevent anal abscesses\nThere isn't much known about how to prevent anal abscess.\nBut there are some steps you can take, including:\nProtection against STIs and prompt treatment is important for any infection.\nCondom use, especially during anal sex, is key in preventing STIs that may cause anal abscesses.\nGood hygiene and cleanliness in the anal area is an important safeguard for both children and adults.\nAnal abscesses can cause complications, but they're

    "document": ". St. Vincent de Paul (Feast Day July 19th) by Fr.\nFrancis Xavier Weninger, 1877Saint Vincent de Paul (c. 1580-1660), founder of the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians) and co-founder of the Sisters of Charity, is an outstanding example of great love for the poor and unfortuanate, and the patron of charitable societies.\nV incent de Paul, a Frenchman, was born at Pouy, not far from Dax, in Gascony, and from his boyhood was remarkable for his exceeding charity towards the poor.\nFrom the care of his father's flocks he was sent to study letters.\nHe learned the humanities at Dax, and theology first at Toulouse, then at Saragossa.\nHaving been ordained priest, and having taken a degree in theology, he fell into the hands of the Turks, and was led captive by them into Africa.\nBut being sold into slavery, he won his owner (an apostate) back to Christ.\nBy the help of the Mother of God, therefore, Vincent and his owner hurried away from the shores of the barbarians.\nThen Vincent undertook a journey to Rome, to visit the thresholds of the Apostles.\nHaving returned to France he governed, in a most saintly manner, first, the parish of Clichy, and then that of Chatillon.\nHe was appointed by the king as principal chaplain of the French galleys, and showed marvelous zeal in striving for the salvation of both the drivers and the rowers.\nThe holy Francis de Sales appointed him superior of the nuns of the Visitation, whom he ruled for nearly forty years with so great prudence, that he amply justified the opinion of their most holy founder, who confessed that he knew no worthier priest than Vincent.\nT o the preaching of the Gospel unto the poor, especially to the country people, he devoted himself unweariedly, until he was disabled by old age.\nTo this apostolic work he obligated both himself and the members of the congregation, which he specially founded under the name of secular Priests of the Mission, by a perpetual vow confirmed by the Holy See.\nAnd how greatly he labored for bettering the discipline of the clergy, is attested by the seminaries erected for senior clerics, by the frequency of sacred conferences among the priests, and by the religious exercises preparatory to the sacrament of Holy Orders; for which purposes, as well as that of giving pious retreats for laymen, he desired that the houses of his institute should be freely opened.\nMoreover, for the extension of faith and piety, he sent evangelical laborers, not only into the provinces of France, but also into Italy, Poland, Scotland, Ireland, and even to Barbary and to the Indies.\nAnd at the death of Louis XIII, whom he had attended and exhorted on his deathbed, Vincent himself was summoned by the queen, Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV, and made a member of the young King's Council of Conscience.\nIn this position he most zealously urged that only the more worthy men should be placed in authority over the churches and monasteries; that civil discords, single combats, slowly-spreading false doctrines, which he both perceived and dreaded, should be ended; and that due obedience should be rendered by all to the apostolic decisions.\nT here was no kind of misfortune which he did not, with fatherly tenderness, endeavor to relieve.\nThe faithful groaning beneath the Turkish yoke, infants which had been abandoned, wayward youths, maidens exposed to danger, nuns driven from their convents, fallen women, convicts condemned to the galleys, infirm strangers, disabled workmen and even lunatics, and beggars without number, all these he received and devoutly assisted with resources and in hospices which have lasted to this day.\nWhen Lorraine, Champagne, Picardy, and other provinces were devastated by plague, famine, and war, he relieved their necessities with an open hand.\nHe founded many societies for seeking out and alleviating the lot of the wretched, among them a celebrated association of matrons, widely spread under the name of Sisters of Charity.\nHe likewise promoted the foundation of the Daughters of the Cross, of Providence, and of St. Genevieve, for the education of the weaker sex.\nA mid these and other most important affairs he was ever intent upon God, affable to everyone, and always true to himself, simple, upright, lowly, and ever shrank from honors, riches, and luxuries.\nHe was heard to say that in nothing was there any pleasure for him except in Christ Jesus, Whom he desired to imitate in all things.\nAt length, worn out with bodily pains, labors, and old age, on September 27th, in the year of salvation 1660, and in the eighty-fifth year of age, at Paris, in the house of St. Lazare, which is the mother-house of the Congregation the Mission, he calmly fell asleep.\nSince he became illustrious for virtues, merits, and miracles, Clement XII placed him among the Saints, assigning July 19th as his annual feast.\nAnd Leo XIII, at the earnest request of many bishops, claimed and appointed this notable hero of divine charity, who has deserved so exceedingly well of every class of men the special patron before God of all the charitable societies existing in the entire Catholic world, and in any way soever emanating from his foundation.\nPRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS.\nI. T he continual labors and cares of St. Vincent had only one aim: the spiritual welfare of others and the prevention of all offences to God.\nHe declaimed against those who incited others to sin and vice, and thus led them to eternal destruction.\nHe fully comprehended the truth of the words of St. Dionysius the Areopagite: \"Among all divine works none is more divine than laboring with God for the salvation of souls.\"\nHave you no opportunity to perform a work which is so agreeable in the sight of the Lord?\nThink well, and do not neglect it.\nSt. Vincent was also convinced that among all evil works, there is none more evil and displeasing to God than when we incite others to sin and thus assist the devil in gaining souls.\nThose who do this are called by the Holy Fathers of the Church messengers, representatives, vicars of the devil, because they are sent and incited by him to execute his plans for the destruction of men.\nThey are his vicars, because they do that which is really the devil's work.\nStill more severely speaks St. James of Nisibis: \"All those,\" says he, \"deserve the name of devils, who prevent others from keeping those commandments, which appear hard to keep, and who advise them to follow the devices of the flesh.\"\nHe means to say that such people may be regarded as real devils; but I add that they are worse, more hurtful and more to be feared than the devils themselves, as many a person whom Satan cannot tempt, is incited to sin by their flatteries, promises, and still more by their bad example, and, hence is led to destruction.\nIf you, therefore, desire to be a representative of the devil, or his vicar, you ought to be informed that his abiding place belongs also to you.\nAccording to the words of Christ, hell is prepared for the devil and his angels: \"Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels \" (Matth.\nxxv.).\nAngel means a messenger, a representative.\nFor you and your equals, as angels and messengers of the devil; for you, deceiver, as a representative of the devil, for you is hell, and in hell the eternal fire, if you do not leave your wicked ways.\nEndeavor to repair the evil you have occasioned, and do penance.\nWhat will you do?\nII.\nT he countenance of the dying St. Vincent expressed the comfort and happiness that filled his soul.\nThis was probably because he thought of his innocent life, his zeal in the service of God, his constant endeavor to do good.\nYou may well believe me when I say that you will not be thus consoled in your last hour, when you remember your sinful, unchaste life, your negligence in the service of the Almighty, your idleness in performing good works.\nThe recollection of them will cause you inexpressible fear and horror.\nBefore all, will the thought of those sins torment you which you committed so wantonly, and which you have not even confessed rightly, much less expiated.\n\"They shall come with fear at the thought of their sins,\" says the Holy Ghost, \"and their iniquities shall stand against them to convict them.\"\n(Wisdom, iv).\nThe wicked Antiochus did not heed his sins during the time that his health was unimpaired; he gave them not even a thought: but when his last hour approached, he said: \"But now I remember the evils that I did in Jerusalem.\"\n(I. Macc, vi.)\nNow, not before: now that I am called into eternity, to appear before the judgment-seat of the Most High, now I remember them against my will.\nBut what resulted from this remembrance?\n\"Into what tribulation am I come, and into what floods of sorrow.\"\n(I. Mace, vi.)\nIf you would not experience equal woes, but die comforted and happy, lead a Christian life after the example of St. Vincent.\nAvoid evil, and practice good works.\nShould your conscience be stained with sin, expiate it by sincere penance, without losing another day.\nNovena Prayer in Honor of St. Vicent de Paul\nO glorious Saint Vincent, heavenly patron of all charitable associations and father of all who are in misery, whilst thou wast on earth thou didst never cast out any who came to thee; ah, consider by what evils we are oppressed and come to our assistance!\nObtain from thy Lord help for the poor, relief for the infirm, consolation for the afflicted, protection for the abandoned, a spirit of generosity for the rich, the grace of conversion for sinners, zeal for priests, peace for the Church, tranquillity and order for all nations, and salvation for them all.\nYea, let all men prove the effects of thy merciful intercession, so that, being helped by thee in the miseries of this life, we may be united to thee in the life to come, where there shall be no more grief, nor weeping, nor sorrow, but joy and gladness and everlasting happiness.\nAmen  (Indulgence of 300 days; plenary indulgence once a month, on the usual conditions, for the daly devout recitation of this prayer.\n--Pius IX., Nov. 23, 1876)________________________________________The Litany of St. Vincent de Paul (For Private Use Only)Lord, have mercy.\nLord, have mercy.\nChrist have mercy.\nChrist have mercy.\nLord, have mercy.\nLord, have mercy.\nChrist, hear us, Christ, graciously hear us.\nGod the Father of heaven, Have mercy on us.\nGod the Son, Redeemer of the world, Have mercy on us.\nGod the Holy Ghost, Have mercy on us.\nHoly Trinity, one God, Have mercy on us.\nHoly Mary, Pray for us.\n* Saint Vincent de Paul,* St. Vincent, who at the tenderest age didst display a wisdom most mature,* St. Vincent, who from thy childhood wast full of pity and compassion,* St. Vincent, who like David, from a simple shepherd becamest the ruler and pastor of the people of God,* St. Vincent, who in thy captivity didst preserve perfect freedom,* St. Vincent the just man, who didst live by faith,* St. Vincent, always supported on the firm anchor of a Christian hope,* St. Vincent, always inflamed with the fire of charity,* St. Vincent, truly simple, upright, and fearing God,* St. Vincent, true disciple of Jesus Christ, always meek and humble of heart,* St. Vincent, perfectly mortified in heart and mind,* St. Vincent, ever animated with the spirit of Jesus Christ,* St. Vincent, generous maintainer of the glory of God,* St. Vincent, ever inwardly burning and ever outwardly transported with zeal for souls,* St. Vincent, who in Christian poverty didst find the precious pearl, and the rich treasure of the Gospel,* St. Vincent, like to the Angels in thy purity,* St. Vincent, ever faithful in obedience and ever victorious in word,* St. Vincent, from thy earliest years constantly devoted to works of charity,* St. Vincent, who didst fly with most diligent care the slightest appearance of evil,* St. Vincent, who in all thine actions, didst aspire to the practice of the most perfect virtue,* St. Vincent, who, like a rock, remainedst immovable amidst the stormy sea of this world,* St. Vincent, who, constant as the sun in its course, wentest ever onward in the paths of truest wisdom,* St. Vincent, always invincible by all the arrows of adversity,* St. Vincent, as patient in suffering as thou wast indulgent in forgiving,* St. Vincent, ever docile and obedient son of the holy Roman Church,* St. Vincent, who hadst exceeding horror of the novel ways and subtle words of heresy,* St. Vincent, destined by a special Providence to announce the Gospel to the poor,* St. Vincent, tender father and perfect model of ecclesiastics,* St. Vincent, prudent founder of the Congregation of the Mission,* St. Vincent, wise institutor of the order of the Sisters of Charity,* St. Vincent, always tender in compassionating and always prompt in relieving the necessities of the poor,* St. Vincent, equally fervent in the practice of prayer and in ministry of the word,* St. Vincent, perfect imitator of the life and virtues of Jesus Christ,* St. Vincent, who didst persevere to the end in eschewing evil and doing good,* St. Vincent, who, as in life so in death, wast most precious in the sight of God,*  [St. Vincent, who by the knowledge of absolute truth, by the love of sovereign goodness, by the joys of a blessed eternity, possessest perfect happiness,* Pray for the members of the Church, and especially for the members of this brotherhood.]\nLamb of God, Who takest away the sins of the world, Spare us, O Lord.\nLamb of God, Who takest away the sins of the world, Graciously hear us, O Lord.\nLamb of God, Who takes away the sins of the world, Have mercy on us.\nV.

Henry Beford, 1856T here are few institutions in Paris which excite more admiration in strangers than the Foundling Asylum, the Hospice des Enfans trouves, in the Rue d'Enfer.\nNo one can visit it without being moved with feelings of love and veneration for St. Vincent de Paul, whose work it is; and when we call to mind the difficulties he had to encounter in first establishing it, and the still greater trials which threatened its very existence while it was yet young, we shall indeed acknowledge that it is His work who taught His servant to say, \"When my father and mother forsook me, the Lord took me up.\"\nL et us trace up this noble institution to its source in the charity of Vincent.\nNothing could be more deplorable than the state of the poor foundlings of Paris when they first attracted the attention of our Saint.\nNot less than three or four hundred children were yearly left exposed by their parents in the public streets; and what does the reader think was the provision made by the government of that day for these little outcasts of society?\nIt sounds well when we hear that a police regulation required that every child thus found should be taken by certain officers to a house appointed for their reception; but if we follow these officers to La Couche, in the Rue St. Landry, what preparations do we find for the nurture and care of this crowd of helpless infants?\nA widow, with two or three servants; and these so miserably paid, that the barest necessities of life cannot be obtained for those who need the most delicate attention and care!\nThere are no wet-nurses for the youngest, no fitting food for those who have been weaned.\nI t naturally followed, that the greater part died almost immediately; while most of those who lingered on in a sickly existence were quieted in their pains, and in the end silenced for ever, by narcotics, which were given them by their ruthless guardians.\nWell was it for those who died thus; for they thereby escaped a harder and more cruel fate.\nHumanity shudders when it thinks of the lot of those who were given away, or sold for a few pence, to any who would take them from a place which it sounds like mockery to call their home.\nSome were hired to suck the milk from diseased breasts, who thus with their nurture drew in death; while others--horrible to relate--were bought as victims for diabolic art, and ministered with their blood to the requirements of those who sought therein restoration to health and a revival of the powers which sin and excess had corrupted and destroyed.\nThe bath of infants' blood is no mere classic dream; for the seventeenth century saw revived (if they had ever really ceased) the mystic charms and satanic remedies which heathenism had used.\nAnd while the bodies of these little ones were thus neglected and suffered to perish, none cared for their souls.\nThe miserable creature who had the nominal care of them herself confessed that she had never baptised one, nor did she know of a single case in which that blessed sacrament had been administered!\nAnd yet three or four hundred yearly entered her house.\nT his gigantic evil crossed Vincent's path: his tender heart recoiled in horror from cruelty so great and from neglect so terrible.\nTo pass it with an exclamation of surprise or disgust, to drop over it a tear of sorrow, and thus to leave it, was not his way.\nHis was an active charity, which shrank from no difficulty, and knew not the word \"impossible.\"\nYet was he prudent and cautious in what he undertook.\nHe did nothing on impulse; and so he never gave up what he once began.\nThus, in this case as in others, he considered long and carefully what he should do; he weighed his means against the requirements, and found that he must begin in a small way.\nHe called in the aid of the good ladies of the Hotel-Dieu, and sent them to examine the state of \" La Couche.\"\nThey went, and saw what has been related.\nWhat language could express their astonishment and distress at the spectacle which there presented itself!\nHow can they meet so great a claim upon their charity?\nhow cope with so overwhelming an evil?\nUnder Vincent's advice, they agree to select by lot twelve of these poor creatures, and place them in a house near the gate of St. Victor.\nMadame Le Gras and her Sisters of Charity undertook the immediate charge of them, and wet-nurses were provided.\nI t was in 1638 that this first step was taken, and gradually the number thus selected was augmented as the means for their support increased; and the contrast between those who had been thus taken and those who were left behind moved the hearts of these generous ladies to make greater sacrifices in their behalf.\nThus matters went on for two years; at the end of which time, in 1640, Vincent called these ladies together, and laid before them a design for completing the work by taking charge of all these foundlings.\nI t was an arduous and costly task; and his prudence would not suffer him to do more than urge them to make trial of their strength and means.\nAll he wished them to do was to make an experiment.\nIf their resources would not suffice, they must give it up; in the meantime he would try what he could do for them.\nH e was a man of business, and sat down to count the cost of the enterprise; and this was the pecuniary view of the case.\nThe ladies had no more than 70 of fixed income which they could devote to this work: at Vincent's request, the queen regent, Anne of Austria, ever forward in works of charity, gave an annual grant of 600; and to this our Saint added all that he could spare from the resources of\nSt. Lazarus and from the funds which the charitable placed at his disposal.\nAfter all, there was a large additional sum required to meet the necessary expenditure, which was certainly not less than 2,000 ayear.\nN obly did they struggle on against all difficulties for some years; every nerve seemed strained, every power taxed to the uttermost, to carry on the undertaking and to preserve the poor deserted ones from the fate which awaited them should they have to return to their old quarters.\nBut now difficulties increase: national distress shows itself on all sides, the curse of faction once more comes over the land, sin and misery rise together in greater force than ever; and so the demands upon this especial charity augment with its increasing poverty.\nMoreover, the famine which at this time afflicted the province of Lorraine called for unexampled relief; and those who had burdened themselves with the charge of the foundlings are now foremost in aiding the efforts which Vincent is making for the support of thousands of their starving countrymen.\nC an we wonder if at such a time the hearts of these noble women should despond, and that their resolution respecting the orphans should falter?\nCommon prudence seemed to urge them to consolidate their energies on the more pressing need, and to give up, at least for a time, what, after all, had been undertaken only as an experiment.\nSuch was the state of affairs in 1648, when Vincent took his resolution, and called once more around him those liberal souls who were doing so much.\nT he general meeting is held; Vincent is there, and in the crowd of those present we may observe Madame Le Gras, as well as Madame de Goussault.\nEvery heart beats high with anxiety--for what will Vincent advise?\nHe is so cautious, so prudent, that, it may be, the more enthusiastic are half-inclined to condemn his counsel beforehand; while those who have more calmly weighed the matter in hand sigh as they feel the necessity of drawing back from what seems a hopeless task.\nAt any rate there is this consolation, that they have done their best; and that, had not these national calamities come so unexpectedly upon them, they might still have persevered.\nIt is painful, indeed, to draw back; but is it not madness to go on?\nThus they thought; and therefore their hearts were sad, and many a bright eye was dimmed with tears for those whom they were about to abandon.\nB ut what thinks Vincent all this while?\nIt may be that their own thoughts occupy them too exclusively, or those ladies might have marked a determination about the Saint's brow, and a sweet expression of ardent charity in those benignant eyes, which would in part have revealed the purpose within his mind.\nA nd now Vincent rises; and in breathless silence they listen to the words of their sage counsellor, while he weighs the momentous question, whether they shall continue or give up the charge of the poor foundlings.\nCalmly and impartially does he set forth the reasons on both sides.\nHe reminds them that it is only an experiment they have been making, and that consequently they are not bound by any obligation to continue it.\nBut then he fails not also to call to their remembrance the fruit of their labours; how five or six hundred infants have been snatched from the hands of death, many of whom have learnt, and others were now being taught trades, by means of which they cease to be an expense to any one.\nHe then goes on to tell them how through their care these little ones have been brought to know and to serve God; how with their earliest accents they have learned to speak of Him; and what bright hopes for a happy future these good beginnings presage.\nAs he speaks, his words grow warmer; and at last, with deep emotion, and with irresistible sweetness, he exclaims: \"Yes, ladies, compassion and charity have led you to adopt these little creatures for your children; you became their mothers by grace, when those who are their mothers by nature abandoned them; see now, if you too will forsake them.\nCease to be their mothers, that you may become their judges; their life and death are in your hands.\nI have now to receive your decision.\nThe time has come for you to pronounce sentence, and to declare whether or no you will still have pity on them.\nIf you continue your charitable care over them, they will live; if you abandon them, they will undoubtedly perish.\nYour own experience forbids you to doubt it.''\nT he result may be easily imagined.\nCost what it might, the good work should go on; and with tearful eyes but joyful hearts, they resolved to take courage from the words of Vincent, and to persevere in what was so evidently the will of God.\nT he king granted them the chateau at Bicetre, which Louis XIII.\nhad destined for invalided soldiers; and thither for a time they sent the infants who had been weaned; but the air proving too keen, they were soon brought back to Paris, and lodged in a house near St. Lazarus.\nHere they were intrusted to twelve Sisters of Charity, who brought them up, and communicated to them the first rudiments of education.\nThose who were not yet weaned were given in charge to some country women, and were visited from time to time by the sisters, and occasionally by the Fathers of the Mission.\nI n course of time two houses were bought for these children.\nLouis XIV.\nincreased the annual grant which his mother had made; and the good queen-dowager continued throughout her life the patronage she had so generously extended to the charity in the hour of its greatest need.\nFrom that day to this the institution has flourished; and those who visit it in its present habitation in the Rue d'Enfer, or in any other of its many dwelling-places, find as of old the Sisters of Charity carrying on the very work Vincent left in their hands, and recognise in its vitality another token of the heavenly mission of him whose works not only remain in vigorous life to the present day, but grow and expand with the wants and necessities of each succeeding age.http://catholicharboroffaithandmorals.com/\n\n",

You think, 'I can change things.'\nAnd then all these things, of course, never improve and then you start ... seeing mothers separated from their calves; you start seeing trainers being killed, and then they blame [the trainers] for their own deaths.\n\"He said his \"final straw\" was when Sea\nWorld publicly testified that \"they had no knowledge we had a dangerous job.\n\"The documentary Blackfish, released in 2013, covers Brancheau's death and an incident two months earlier at a theme park in Spain when an orca killed a trainer named Alexis Martinez.\nThe federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated Brancheau's death and concluded Sea\nWorld had exposed trainers to hazardous conditions; it fined the corporation.\nIn its order, later upheld on appeal, OSHA also banned Sea\nWorld from permitting its personnel to enter the tanks to train and perform with orcas, a practice known as water work.\nNow Hargrove has a new book, called Beneath the Surface.\nHe is one of seven former trainers who criticized the company in Blackfish.\nFresh Air 's Davies also spoke with representatives of Sea\nWorld in a separate interview.\nThe company denies that it treats its whales poorly.\n\"There's a theme and maybe a bit of exaggeration about each of these processes as described in the film  [Blackfish], which I'm certainly familiar with, that really sensationalizes what we're doing, in those stories that are told from the standpoint of those who are criticizing us,\" says Sea\nWorld's vice president of veterinary services, Christopher Dold.\n\"That sensationalism is unfounded.\nEvery decision we make around a social setting for the whales [and] around moving a whale from one park to another one is founded in respect for the animals.\n\"Enlarge this image\nKasatka swims with her calf in 2013.\nHargrove says that when another of Kasatka's calves was taken from her, she emitted \"heartbreaking\" vocalizations.\nSea\nWorld's Chuck Tompkins says Hargrove's \"interpretation\" is different \"from mine or any other trainer that was there.\n\"Mike Aguilera/Getty Images\nWhat's more, Sea\nWorld says, it doesn't take calves away from their mothers.\n\"We don't put any animal in any stressful situation,\" says Sea\nWorld's curator of zoological operations, Chuck Tompkins.\nInterview Highlights\nJohn Hargrove, former Sea\nWorld trainer who wrote Beneath The Surface\nOn a time when Hargrove felt in danger while training the whale named Freya in France\nAs soon as I dove into her pool \u2014 I had another trainer throw me some fish \u2014 Freya came at me and I offered the fish to her, [but] she refused the fish and she immediately started pushing me with a closed mouth.\n[She pushed] into my chest, pushing me into the middle of the pool.\n...\nI was trying to deflect off her, best I could, but those animals are so incredibly agile, there's no way, so she just stayed on me.\n... She had me right in the middle of the pool.\nThey do that because you're farthest away from safety, you're farthest away from land, you're farthest away from the other trainers.\nAnd then she [dragged] the entire length of the side of her body down my body, making contact.\n...\nI didn't know if she was going to hit me in the head with her [tail], which would've easily broken my neck.\nShe did not do that, thankfully and obviously, but then she went under.\nAnd she ultimately sank down below me, she turned sideways, she opened her mouth and she put the entire width of my body in her mouth \u2014 right as I called out to the trainer that was closest to me to get ready to call paramedics.\nShe pulled me under as soon as I said that last word.\n...\nI had seen trainers be pulled under by whales before and I had been pulled under by whales before, but I had never seen a whale grab a trainer by their torso before.\nSo to feel her entire jaws \u2014 and she's 7,000 pounds \u2014 around my hip bones, I mean ... looking her in the eye during the entire incident ...\nI knew she wasn't going to let me swim out.\nOn the first time he saw a show at Sea\nWorld when he was 6 years old\nIt was 1980; it was the first time I ever went to Sea\nWorld.\nI was with my mother and my stepfather and it was the first Shamu stadium show that I saw.\nAnd I just remember being so seduced and mesmerized by it, just seeing this large stadium and 5,000 people and these incredible animals and seeing people in the water with these animals.\nAnd, of course, I was already an animal lover, but I had never seen anything the size and [with] the magnificence of a killer whale.\n...\nIt hit me at a cellular level and never left me.\nI obsessively pursued it from that point forward.\nWhat the killer whale show is like at Sea\nWorld and how big the animals are\nWe would try to show the smaller water-work behaviors that would really show off our relationship with the animals.\nWe would call them \"playtimes\" \u2014 that's our lingo for setting up the show.\nUltimately we'd work our way up to the more dramatic behaviors, the hydro-hops, the rocket-hops, where you see the whales throwing us through the air and we're diving off the whales, surf rides [you stand on the whale's back and surf on them].\n...\nSo we would like to show both \u2014 the smaller behaviors [that] show the relationship, and then get into the big, dramatic stuff that you can't do off a dolphin, but you can do off of an 8,000-pound killer whale, just because of the sheer size and strength of the animal.\nThe largest female in the world \u2014 actually the first killer whale I ever swam with, Corky \u2014 she's in California.\nShe's still alive; she's 8,200 pounds.\nTilikum, who killed Dawn, is 12,000 pounds.\nUlises in California, he's an adult male; he's 10,000 pounds now \u2014 so you can see the radical difference in size.\n...\nEven the smallest behaviors we do on the animals, people don't realize the force that that creates on our body and the compression on our joints when you're having an 8,000-pound animal push you around the pool.\nYou're not effortlessly gliding through the water like most people think.\nIt's like having two SUVs pushing you around and you're just on one foot.\nOn separating calves from their mothers\nThis is one of the most infuriating things to me because I can tell you \u2014 my own personal knowledge, [so] this is a conservative number \u2014 I know of 19 calves we have taken from their mothers.\n...\nThis is where Sea\nWorld tries to be clever and tries to get people with semantics.\nWhat they've tried to do is redefine the word \"calf\" by saying a calf is no longer a calf once they're not nursing with their mother anymore, and that's simply not true.\nA calf is always a calf.\nFor example, Kasatka and Takara, when they were separated when Takara was 12, Takara is still Kasatka's calf and they would remain together for life in the wild.\n...\nSea\nWorld has separated mothers from their calves before they had stopped nursing.\nThey took Keet away from Kalina, and he was only 20 months old and he was still nursing.\nOn the process of separating the whales\nWe trick the whales when ... there's a separation like that.\n...\nThe whales are so smart they know that even if they hear the cranes coming up the pathway [to lift them out of the pool] or certainly if they see them, they won't separate, they won't allow it to happen because they know the possibility ... that one of the members of their family or their social group could be taken away from them.\n... You'll [hear] extremely upset vocalizations from whales that are ... being taken away, and then the whales that they're being taken away from.\nIn fact, [when calf Takara was taken from Kasatka], she was emitting vocalizations that had never been heard before ever by anyone.\nThey brought in one of their own Sea\nWorld researchers ... she analyzed those vocals and determined that they were long-range vocals and ... because obviously Takara was gone and [Kasatka] was trying anything she could to try to locate and communicate with Takara, which is absolutely heartbreaking.\nThose vocalizations continued on for a long time.\n...\nThis information was communicated to me by a senior manager from Shamu Stadium at Sea\nWorld of California, so obviously that was their determination of their vocalizations, which was communicated to me, rightfully so, so there's no real gray area for any misinterpretation of what those vocalizations might have meant.\nEveryone clearly understood that it was an extremely traumatic event for both Kasatka and Takara.\nOn Sea\nWorld saying it pays a lot of attention to social groups\nIf they paid such careful attention to that they wouldn't have taken Kohana from Takara.\nKohana was only 3 years old.\n... Ironically up on Sea\nWorld's page, \"The Truth About [The Movie] Blackfish, \" they have a picture of Takara with her calf Kohana, and they say that \"we do not separate mothers from their calves.\"\nOK, right now Takara is at Sea\nWorld of Texas and Kohana is in Spain.\nSo they are separated and they actually took Kohana away from Takara when she was only 3 years old and that put Kohana in a social situation where she had no mother, at the age of 3, and no other adult female.\nSo what happened was she was inbred with her uncle, Keto.\nHe inbred her twice, she had the calf, and because she was just a baby, really, she had no other whale to learn from, no mother to learn from, she rejected both of her calves and the second calf died within its first year.\nOn the death of Sea\nWorld trainer Brancheau\nDawn was very experienced.\nShe was working with Tilikum during a [Shamu performance].\n... She was working with Tilikum the way she was allowed to work with Tilikum.\nShe wasn't breaking any rules or protocols; she wasn't swimming with him.\nAnd he made the choice to grab her and pull her into the pool.\nWe will never know why Tilikum made that choice and we will never know for sure if Tilikum intended to kill her or if he was just in such a rage, but what we do know, without question, even though Sea\nWorld denies it now publicly (but internally we never denied it, and we always discussed it as so), was that it was an aggressive event.\nSo even in court in the OSHA hearings, Sea\nWorld attempted ... to say it was not aggressive behavior.\nBut I can tell you [that at] all of our senior-level internal meetings, we always discussed it as what it was, which was a highly aggressive event.\nHe didn't just drown Dawn; he dismembered her.\nOn aggressive behavior at Sea\nWorld\nI think [it's] extremely rare when [trainers] are killed and they're dismembered like with Alexis [Martinez] and Dawn.\nBut aggression towards trainers is not extremely rare.\nAnd, in fact, we just keep that from the public.\nIf it doesn't happen in the media, if the media doesn't get a hold of it, then you guys never hear about it.\nOn his injuries from being a trainer\nI've had major sinus surgery here in New York, where they had to cut out scar tissue in all four compartments of my sinuses and saw away bone because so many years of being exposed to the cold water had caused my bones to thicken in my skull.\nI have major cartilage destruction in both of my knees and in my back.\nI've lacerated my face to the skull \u2014 17 stitches to close up.\nI've broken my foot; I've broken toes; I've broken fingers; I've broken my ribs two times.\nI've been treated for thoracic strain ... but I have a laundry list of injuries and they're only going to get worse.\nI'm 41 years old now, and I have these injuries.\nChristopher Dold, Sea\nWorld's vice president of veterinary services, and Chuck Tompkins, Sea\nWorld's curator of zoological operations\nOn separating calves from their mothers\nChuck Tompkins: We've never moved a calf from a mom.\n... A calf is an animal young enough who is still dependent on the mom, still nursing with the mom, and still requires the mom's leadership.\n... You can't put it in human years; you've got to put it in killer whale years.\nWe think they're probably dependent [at] 4 to 5 years.\nAfter that, they start to gain their independence.\n... For the animals we have moved, we obviously are aware of what we're doing and what we're about to do, and we prepare those animals for that move.\n... We've trained them to be relaxed during that move.\nTo say that they're uncomfortable or stressed, that's just not the way we do our business at Sea\nWorld.\nOn the process of separating the whales\nTompkins:  [Hargrove's] interpretation of the environment is completely different from mine or any other trainer that was there.\nThese animals are very vocal and anytime you're doing something different in the environment, these animals can become vocal.\nNever during these situations have we heard those types of vocals that would indicate stress ... or anything of that nature, or we wouldn't continue with the process.\nMore On Sea\nWorld\nThe Two-Way\nSea\nWorld CEO Steps Down Amid Controversy, Drop In Attendance\nAround the Nation\nSea\nWorld Hopes New Orca Habitats Will Stem A Tide Of Criticism\nAnimals\nMonths After 'Blackfish' Release, Controversy Over Sea\nWorld Grows\nChristopher Dold: The way we manage our whales, as close as we are with the whales that we care for in our parks, it is very different than what a wild killer whale experiences.\nRemember, 80 percent of our whales or more now were born at a park at Sea\nWorld.\nSo one of the fundamental differences between a wild killer whale and the killer whales that live at our parks is they have humans working with them every day.\nHuman beings are a part of their lives.\nSo, when we move a killer whale away from killer whales [that] it has been living with for a long time \u2014 and that may be a mother killer whale or another sibling \u2014 some of that social group still goes with that whale.\nIf it isn't a couple of the whales already that it grew up with moving with it, it's the trainers that that whale knows, as well as the other whales in its environment.\nOn the death of Sea\nWorld trainer Brancheau\nTompkins: I was actually the company spokesman during that time and, to be clear, I worked with Dawn her entire career.\n... That was a terrible, emotional time for a lot of people.\nWe knew the facts; and as much as we could at the time, we knew that her hair was grabbed, but that was not blaming anybody.\nWe never, never publicly came out and blamed Dawn for anything.\nI think our company was absolutely stellar in taking the approach that we would find out all the information.\nAnd to this day, we still have not blamed Dawn for anything that happened.\nRead an excerpt of Beneath the Surface\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nEmail\nSubscribe to the Fresh Air Podcast\nListen on NPR One\nApple Podcasts\nRSS\n\n",

and Dead Space, You\nTube banned Fischbach's Ad\nSense account.\nThough he appealed to You\nTube as a last effort, the appeal was ultimately lost.\n[20] Because of this, a new and current channel was created on May 26, 2012  [21] and dubbed Markiplier\nGAME.\nChannel growth and move to Los Angeles (2014)Markiplier in 2014In 2014, the Markiplier\nGAME channel was listed on New\nMedia\nRockstars Top 100 Channels, ranked at number 61.\n[22] That year, Fischbach announced he was planning to move to Los Angeles, California, to be able to be closer to other resources for his channel, such as the You\nTube Space and other content creators.\n[23] Fischbach and fellow You\nTuber Jenna Mae appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\nin September 2014 following backlash that Kimmel received regarding jokes he had made about You\nTube and Let's Play videos.\n[7] In 2015, he was rated sixth in a list of the twenty most influential celebrities among teenagers in the United States.\n[24]Hiatus and breaking 10 million subscribers (2015)Beginning in 2015, Fischbach lived with fellow You\nTubers Daniel Kyre and Ryan Magee, who created and ran the You\nTube sketch comedy and music channel Cyndago.\nMatt Watson from Maker Studios later joined Cyndago after they moved to Los Angeles.\nTheir work was noted for having unexpected endings and dark, often disturbing, humor.\n[25]  [26] Cyndago was disbanded following the death of Daniel Kyre.\n[27] At the time of their disbandment, the group had done forty sketches and fourteen original songs, many of them featuring Fischbach.\n[25] After the death of Daniel Kyre and disbandment of Cyndago, Fischbach temporarily halted uploads and went on hiatus from September 17, 2015 to October 5, 2015.\n[28] His return was shortly followed by the channel reaching 10 million subscribers on October 15, 2015.\n[29] Watson and Magee moved on to create a gaming channel called Super\nMega.\n[30]Quitting alcohol and continued growth (2015-present)Markiplier appearing in a Vlogbrothers video in 2016In late 2015, Fischbach announced in a video that he had chosen to abstain from alcohol because of a deficient enzyme important to the process of breaking down alcohol.\nThe decision came after an incident where he suffered a transient ischemic attack and had to be taken to the hospital, and was advised by the doctors to do so.\nHe said that because of this a popular series of his, Drunk Minecraft, would no longer be produced.\n[31]In September 2015, Fischbach dyed his hair pink for a charity along with Jacksepticeye  [32] He later dyed his hair to blue in November 2015 and then red in March 2016  [33] and back to black on December 29, 2016 in time for 2017.\n[34]Fischbach co-hosted the 2015 South by Southwest (SXSW) Gaming Awards with The Legend of Korra voice actor Janet Varney,  [35] and was featured prominently in You\nTube's year-end special You\nTube Rewind.\nIn January 2016, Fischbach signed to Revelmode, a subnetwork to Maker Studios, along with other You\nTubers such as Jacksepticeye and Pew\nDie\nPie.\nRevelmode was disbanded in early 2017 as a result of Pew\nDie\nPie being cut from Maker Studios.\nHe subsequently signed to another Maker Studios sub-network, Polaris.\nThroughout 2016, Fischbach moved some of his focus to comedy sketches, showing his aspiration of improvisational theatre.\nIn 2017, Fischbach posted an interactive Choose Your Own Adventure style video titled \"A Date With Markiplier\", which was well received by fans.\n[36]  [37] The You\nTuber also surpassed 15 million subscribers that year.\nIn late 2016, Fischbach formed a team, nicknamed \"Teamiplier\", to assist in the creation of his videos and more high-quality sketches, including his girlfriend Amy, and his friends Ethan, Tyler and Kathryn.\n[38]Other ventures\nMarkiplier in Rosemont, Illinois for his \"You're Welcome Tour\", October 2017Fischbach joined the board of comic book publisher Red Giant Entertainment in November 2014.\n[39] In June of that year at the San Diego Comic-Con, he had cohosted a panel with figures from the company including CEO Benny R. Powell, and writers David Campiti, Mort Castle, David Lawrence, and Brian Augustyn.\n[40] In 2016, it was announced that he would appear in his own line of comics.\n[41]Fischbach signed with William Morris Endeavor in late 2016, having expressed interest in branching out from You\nTube content.\n[42]In 2017, he embarked on his first improv tour, known as the \"You're Welcome Tour\", along with Ethan Nestor-Darling (Crank\nGame\nPlays), Wade Barnes (Lord\nMinion777), Tyler Scheid (Apocalypto12) and Bob Muyskens (muyskerm), initially on a short four-date trip in mid 2017 before stretching to a full tour across North America and Europe in October 2017 through to 2018.\nFilmography\nFilm\nYear Title Role Ref (s)2015 Smosh: The Movie Himself  [14]Television and web series\nYear Title Role Notes Ref (s)2013\u20132014 Table Flip Himself 3 episodes2015 Jimmy Kimmel Live!\nHimself 1 episode  [7]2015 Grumpcade Himself 20 episodes2016 Isabelle Ruins Everything Apollo Short2016 Scare Pew\nDie\nPie Himself 1 episode2016 Gamer's Guide to Pretty Much Everything Himself 1 episode  [15]2017\u2013present Villainous 5.0.5 main role  [43]  [44]Awards and nominations\nYear Nominated Award Result Ref (s)2016 Streamy Awards Gaming Nominated\nShorty Awards Tech and Innovation: Gaming Nominated\nMake-A-Wish Foundation Award Ceremony Celebrity of The Year Won  [45]2017 Golden Joystick Awards Best Streamer/Broadcaster Won  [46]See also\nList of most subscribed users on You\nTube\nList of You\nTube personalities\nBiography portal Video Games portal California portal\nReferences^ \"ANXIETY: Ib Playthrough #4\".\nYou\nTube.\nRetrieved July 6, 2014.^ a b c Do You Know Markiplier?.\nNovember 16, 2016.^ a b c d \"Draw My Life - Markiplier\".\nYou\nTube.\nRetrieved December 23, 2013.^ \"2,000,000\".\nYou\nTube.^ a b \"Markiplier\".\nYou\nTube.\nRetrieved October 10, 2016.^ \"You\nTube Top 100 Most Subscribed Channels List - Top by Subscribers\".\nRetrieved March 1, 2016.^ a b c Hernandez, Patricia.\n\"Famous You\nTubers Go On TV, Teach Jimmy Kimmel A Lesson\".\nKotaku.com.\nRetrieved September 23, 2015.^ \"TALK NERDY TO ME BABY Poly Bridge\".\nMarkiplier.\nYou\nTube.\nRetrieved September 15, 2015.^ \"About - Twokinds - 12 Years on the Net!\".\nRetrieved March 1, 2016.^ Fischbach, Mark.\n\"Markiplier with PINK HAIR?!\".\nYou\nTube.com.\nRetrieved July 21, 2016.^ Fischbach, Mark.\n\"I match now\".\nInstagram.com.\nRetrieved July 21, 2016.^ Fischbach, Mark.\n\"Markiplier With RED Hair?!\".\nYou\nTube.com.\nRetrieved July 21, 2016.^ \"Markiplier makes Jack Black play 'Five Nights at Freddy's 4 ' \".\nSun-Times National.\nArchived from the original on October 14, 2015.\nRetrieved March 13, 2016.^ a b Spangler, Todd.\n\"You\nTube's Smosh Guys on Making Their First Movie: 'We Had to Learn How to Act ' \".\nVariety.\nRetrieved March 7, 2016.^ a b UTC, Chelsea Stark2016-02-12 13:15:20.\n\"Markiplier guest stars on next episode of Disney's 'Gamer's Guide ' \".\nMashable.\nRetrieved March 6, 2016.^ \"Markiplier Raises $75,000 For Charity With 'Super Mario World' Stream On Twitch\".\nTubefilter.\nRetrieved March 7, 2016.^ \"10 Things You Should Know About You\nTube Star Markiplier - Morning Ledger\".\nMorning Ledger.\nRetrieved March 7, 2016.^ Markiplier's \"About\" page on You\nTube^ Fischbach, Mark (June 28, 2017).\n\"Reacting to SECRET old videos!!\".\nYou\nTube.\nRetrieved June 28, 2017.^ Fischbach, Mark (May 29, 2012).\n\"Vlog | THE CHANNEL IS DEAD!\nLONG LIVE THE CHANNEL!\".\nYou\nTube.\nRetrieved June 28, 2017.^ Markiplier\nGAME's \"About\" page on You\nTube^ \"The NMR Top 100 You\nTube Channels: 75-51!\".\nNew Media Rockstars.\nRetrieved January 6, 2015.^ Markiplier (January 20, 2014), Moving to LA!\n!, retrieved April 27, 2016^ Ault, Susanne (July 23, 2015).\n\"Digital Star Popularity Grows Versus Mainstream Celebrities\".\nVariety.\nRetrieved April 27, 2016.^ a b Wall, Cameron (September 20, 2015).\n\"RIP Daniel Kyre\".\nThe Odyssey Newspaper.\nRetrieved September 28, 2015.^ Lipkin, Richard (February 24, 2014).\n\"Youtube duo Cyndago pave their way to Youtube stardom\".\nThe Daily Gamecock.\nRetrieved September 28, 2015.^ Magee, Ryan;

    "document": "Why and How to Use Coconut Oil to Replace Butter? Why and How to Use Coconut Oil to Replace Butter?\nCoconut oil can be a great alternative to butter as it has beneficial ingredients that help promote better health.\nLearn some tips to help make the transition.\nCoconut oil has several health benefits that can help maintain your liver, kidneys, skin, hair and other parts of the body.\nThis ingredient contains caprylic, lauric, and capric acids that allow it to be used as an antioxidant, disinfectant, antibacterial, antimycotic and soothing agent.\nMany who are attempting to build muscle will consume coconut oil because it has lower calories than most other types of oil so the body can quickly convert it to energy.\nPeople who have food allergies such as those to dairy products have trouble using butter to cook.\nMargarine or vegetable shortenings are available to use as a substitute, but a majority of these products contain soybean oil.\nThose that are concerned about the health defects associated with soy may find these options undesirable.\nIt may be a better idea to substitute coconut oil for butter because it has plenty of additional health benefits that other butter substitutes do not.\nCoconut Oil vs. Buttervs.\nBoth solid at room temperature.\nCoconut oil is solid at room temperature, allowing you to use it the same way you would butter.\nOlive or avocado oils are liquids at room temperature, which often makes them unsuitable for applications such as baking.\nCoconut oil will melt at approximately 76 degrees, so those planning on using coconut oil in their recipes will need to avoid keeping their kitchen too warm.\nAdvantage in taste.\nYou can purchase refined or extra virgin oil.\nThe extra virgin brands will have a coconut flavor that can enhance the flavor of desserts or tropical dishes.\nRefined oil will not add any additional flavor to your dish, making it a perfect addition to more savory dishes.\nBoth versions of this oil are readily available at health food stores and supermarkets.\nSuperior nutritional qualities.\nCoconut oil has high amounts of lauric acid that have strong antibacterial properties.\nIt is also believed that coconut oil helps with weight loss because it is composed of short and medium chain fatty acids.\nConsuming coconut oil can also help you manage digestive distress, regulating the blood sugar, strengthening the teeth and bones, and strengthening your immune system.\nCoconut oil costs more than butter.\nOne of the strongest drawbacks to using coconut oil instead of butter is that coconut oil is a great deal more expensive.\nExtra virgin oil also tends to be more expensive than refined coconut oil.\nHow to Substitute Coconut Oil for Butter1.\nWhen can we use coconut oil?\nCoconut oil makes a perfect substitute for butter in stir fry and Thai recipes.\nIf you would like to use coconut oil in baked goods, it is recommended that you use virgin coconut oil because it is semi-solid and has a coconut flavor that will add to the overall flavor of your recipe.\nPeople often recommend using half coconut oil and half clarified butter in recipes or \u00be coconut oil in place of a cup of butter if you are concerned about the coconut flavor altering the taste of your food.2.\nWhich type of coconut oil can we use?\nUnrefined.\nUnrefined or virgin coconut oil has been minimally processed with a small amount of heat during the production process.\nThis version has a mild coconut flavor and scent that is not typically delectable in baked goods.\nExpeller-pressed.\nExpeller pressed oil has been through a deodorizing process that has removed the coconut flavor and scent.\nIndustrial or commercial grade.\nCommercial grade coconut oil has been through a deodorizing, refining and bleaching process to remove any coconut flavor or scent.\nHowever, this means much of the vital nutrients have been removed from the coconut oil as well.3.\nHow to use coconut oil in different forms\nLiquid form.\nMelt your coconut oil over low heat, allowing it to briefly cool before applying it to your recipe.\nYou can simply place a bowl or your jar of oil on the stove while you prepare your other ingredients as the oil will melt quite quickly.\nThen simply use the coconut oil the way you would as any other type of oil.\nIf you are using liquid coconut oil in a cold application, stir it into your recipe quickly so it does not begin to solidify and make your recipe lumpy.\nSolid form.\nAs long as you keep the oil below 76 degrees it will remain solid.\nThis makes it ideal for use in applications like pie crusts.\nYou can beat in your coconut oil with your sweetener the way you would use butter.\nYou can also use coconut oil to grease your pans the way you would use butter.4.\nHow to substitute coconut oil for butter\nMake sure your coconut oil is cool enough to remain solid, particularly if you are working in a warm environment.\nIf necessary, place the coconut oil in the refrigerator until you are ready for it to prevent it from melting.\nBaked goods will need solid coconut oil to make sure the texture turns out the way it should.\nRead your recipe to determine how much coconut oil you need.\nMeasure out your oil.\nYou can use a one to one ratio for the amount of butter your recipe calls for.\n\n",

Eisenhower.\nThe U.\nS. Supreme Court issued its historic Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, 347 U.\nS. 483, on May 17, 1954.\nTied to the 14th Amendment, the decision declared all laws establishing segregated schools to be unconstitutional, and it called for the desegregation of all schools throughout the nation.\n[1] After the decision, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  (NAACP) attempted to register black students in previously all-white schools in cities throughout the South.\nIn Little Rock, the capital city of Arkansas, the Little Rock School Board agreed to comply with the high court's ruling.\nVirgil Blossom, the Superintendent of Schools, submitted a plan of gradual integration to the school board on May 24, 1955, which the board unanimously approved.\nThe plan would be implemented during the fall of the 1957 school year, which would begin in September 1957.\nBy 1957, the NAACP had registered nine black students to attend the previously all-white Little Rock Central High, selected on the criteria of excellent grades and attendance.\n[2] Called the \"Little Rock Nine\", they were Ernest Green  (b.\n1941), Elizabeth Eckford  (b.\n1941), Jefferson Thomas  (1942\u20132010), Terrence Roberts  (b.\n1941), Carlotta Walls La\nNier  (b.\n1942), Minnijean Brown  (b.\n1941), Gloria Ray Karlmark  (b.\n1942), Thelma Mothershed  (b.\n1940), and Melba Pattillo Beals  (b.\n1941).\nErnest Green was the first African American to graduate from Central High School.\nContents [ hide ]1 The Blossom Plan2 National Guard blockade3 Armed escort4 A tense year5 \"The Lost Year\"6 Motivations7 Legacy8 See also9 Footnotes10 References10.1 Historiography10.2 Primary sources10.3 External links\nThe Blossom Plan\nOne of the plans created during attempts to desegregate the schools of Little Rock was by school superintendent Virgil Blossom.\nThe initial approach proposed substantial integration beginning quickly and extending to all grades within a matter of many years.\n[3] This original proposal was scrapped and replaced with one that more closely met a set of minimum standards worked out in attorney Richard B. Mc\nCulloch's brief.\n[4] This finalized plan would start in September 1957 and would integrate one high school, Little Rock Central.\nThe second phase of the plan would take place in 1960 and would open up a few junior high schools to a few black children.\nThe final stage would involve limited desegregation of the city's grade schools at an unspecified time, possibly as late as 1963.\n[4]This plan was met with varied reactions from the NAACP branch of Little Rock.\nMilitant members like the Bateses opposed the plan on the grounds that it was \"vague, indefinite, slow-moving and indicative of an intent to stall further on public integration.\"\n[5] Despite this view, the majority accepted the plan; most felt that Blossom and the school board should have the chance to prove themselves, that the plan was reasonable, and that the white community would accept it.\nThis view was short lived, however.\nChanges were made to the plan, the most detrimental being a new transfer system that would allow students to move out of the attendance zone to which they were assigned.\n[5] The unaltered Blossom Plan had gerrymandered school districts to guarantee a black majority at Horace Mann High and a white majority at Hall High.\n[5] This meant that, even though black students lived closer to Central, they would be placed in Horace Mann thus confirming the intention of the school board to limit the impact of desegregation.\n[5] The altered plan gave white students the choice of not attending Horace Mann, but didn't give black students the option of attending Hall.\nThis new Blossom Plan did not sit well with the NAACP and after failed negotiations with the school board; the NAACP filed a lawsuit on February 8, 1956.\nThis lawsuit, along with a number of other factors contributed to the Little Rock School Crisis of 1957.\nNational Guard blockade\nMain article: Arkansas National Guard and the integration of Central High School\nSeveral segregationist councils threatened to hold protests at Central High and physically block the black students from entering the school.\nGovernor Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to support the segregationists on September 4, 1957.\nThe sight of a line of soldiers blocking out the students made national headlines and polarized the nation.\nRegarding the accompanying crowd, one of the nine students, Elizabeth Eckford, recalled:\nThey moved closer and closer.\n... Somebody started yelling.\n...\nI tried to see a friendly face somewhere in the crowd\u2014someone who maybe could help.\nI looked into the face of an old woman and it seemed a kind face, but when I looked at her again, she spat on me.\n[6]On September 9, the Little Rock School District issued a statement condemning the governor's deployment of soldiers to the school, and called for a citywide prayer service on September 12.\nEven President Dwight Eisenhower attempted to de-escalate the situation by summoning Faubus for a meeting, warning him not to defy the Supreme Court's ruling.\n[7]Armed escort\nYoung U.\nS. Army paratrooper in battle gear outside Central High School, on the cover of Time magazine (October 7, 1957)Woodrow Wilson Mann, the mayor of Little Rock, asked President Eisenhower to send federal troops to enforce integration and protect the nine students.\nOn September 24, the President ordered the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army \u2014without its black soldiers, who rejoined the division a month later\u2014to Little Rock and federalized the entire 10,000-member Arkansas National Guard, taking it out of Faubus's control.\n[8]A tense year\nBy the end of September 1957, the nine were admitted to Little Rock Central High under the protection of the 101st Airborne Division  (and later the Arkansas National Guard ), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse  (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students.\nMelba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes  [9] and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above.\nAnother one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused.\nShe said\nI was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials.\nWe were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened.\nOne girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here.\nWon't you go to lunch with me today?'\nI never saw her again.\n[10]Minnijean Brown was also taunted by members of a group of white male students in December 1957 in the school cafeteria during lunch.\nShe dropped her lunch, a bowl of chili, onto the boys and was suspended for six days.\nTwo months later, after more confrontation, Brown was suspended for the rest of the school year.\nShe transferred to New Lincoln High School in New York City.\n[2] As depicted in the 1981 made-for-TV docudrama Crisis at Central High, and as mentioned by Melba Pattillo Beals in Warriors Don't Cry, white students were punished only when their offense was \"both egregious and witnessed by an adult\".\n[11] The drama was based on a book by Elizabeth Huckaby, a vice-principal during the crisis.\n\"The Lost Year\"In the summer of 1958, as the school year was drawing to a close, Faubus decided to petition the decision by the Federal District Court in order to postpone the desegregation of public high schools in Little Rock.\n[12] In the Cooper v. Aaron case, the Little Rock School District, under the leadership of Orval Faubus, fought for a two and a half year delay on de-segregation, which would have meant that black students would only be permitted into public high schools in January 1961.\n[13] Faubus argued that if the schools remained integrated there would be an increase in violence.\nHowever, in August 1958, the Federal Courts ruled against the delay of de-segregation, which incited Faubus to call together an Extraordinary Session of the State Legislature on August 26 in order to enact his segregation bills.\n[14]Claiming that Little Rock had to assert their rights and freedom against the federal decision, in September 1958, Faubus signed acts that enabled him and the Little Rock School District to close all public schools.\n[15] Thus, with this bill signed, on Monday September 15, Faubus ordered the closure of all four public high schools, preventing both black and white students from attending school.\n[16] Despite Faubus's decree, the city's population had the chance of refuting the bill since the school-closing law necessitated a referendum.\nThe referendum, which would either condone or condemn Faubus's law, was to take place within thirty days.\n[16] A week before the referendum, which was scheduled to take place on September 27, Faubus addressed the citizens of Little Rock in an attempt to secure their votes.\nFaubus urged the population to vote against integration since he was planning on leasing the public school buildings to private schools, and, in doing so, would educate the white and black students separately.\n[17] Faubus was successful in his appeal and won the referendum.\nThis year came to be known as the \"Lost Year.\n\"Faubus's victory led to a series of consequences that affected Little Rock society.\nFaubus's intention to open private schools was denied  [ clarification needed] the same day the referendum took place, which caused some citizens of Little Rock to turn on the black community.\nThe black community became a target for hate crimes since people blamed them for the closing of the schools.\n[18] Daisy Bates, head of the NAACP chapter in Little Rock, was a primary victim to these crimes, in addition to the black students enrolled at Little Rock Central High School and their families.\n[19]The city's teachers were also placed in a difficult position.\nThey were forced to swear loyalty to Faubus's bills.\n[16] Even though Faubus's idea of private schools never played out, the teachers were still expected to attend school every day and prepare for the possibility of their students' return.\n[20] The teachers were completely under Faubus's control and the many months that the school stayed empty only served as a cause for uncertainty in their professional futures.\n[21]In May 1959, after the firing of forty-four teachers and administrative staff from the four high schools, three segregationist board members were replaced with three moderate ones.\nThe new board members reinstated the forty-four staff members to their positions.\n[22] The new board of directors then began an attempt to reopen the schools, much to Faubus's dismay.\nIn order to avoid any further complications, the public high schools were scheduled to open earlier than usual, on August 12, 1959.\n[22]Although the Lost Year had come to a close, the black students who returned to the high schools were not welcomed by the other students.\nRather, the black students had a difficult time getting past mobs to enter the school, and, once inside, they were often subject to physical and emotional abuse.\n[23] The students were back at school and everything would eventually resume normal function, but the Lost Year would be a pretext for new hatred toward the black students in the public high school.\nMotivations\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.\nPlease help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources.\nUnsourced material may be challenged and removed.\n(August 2011)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Faubus's opposition to desegregation was likely both politically and racially motivated.\n[24] Although Faubus had indicated that he would consider bringing Arkansas into compliance with the high court's decision in 1956, desegregation was opposed by his own southern Democratic Party, which dominated all Southern politics at the time.\nFaubus risked losing political support in the upcoming 1958 Democratic gubernatorial primary if he showed support for integration.\n[25]Most histories of the crisis conclude that Faubus, facing pressure as he campaigned for a third term, decided to appease racist elements in the state by calling out the National Guard to prevent the black students from entering Central High.\nFormer associate justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court James D. Johnson claimed to have hoaxed Governor Faubus into calling out the National Guard, supposedly to prevent a white mob from stopping the integration of Little Rock Central High School: \"There wasn't any caravan.\nBut we made Orval believe it.\nWe said.\n'They're lining up.\nThey're coming in droves.'\n...\nThe only weapon we had was to leave the impression that the sky was going to fall.\"\nHe later claimed that Faubus asked him to raise a mob to justify his actions.\n[26]Harry Ashmore, the editor of the Arkansas Gazette, won a 1958 Pulitzer Prize for his editorials on the crisis.\nAshmore portrayed the fight over Central High as a crisis manufactured by Faubus; in his interpretation, Faubus used the Arkansas National Guard to keep black children out of Central High School because he was frustrated by the success his political opponents were having in using segregationist rhetoric to stir white voters.\n[27]Congressman Brooks Hays, who tried to mediate between the federal government and Faubus, was later defeated by a last minute write-in candidate, Dale Alford, a member of the Little Rock School Board who had the backing of Faubus's allies.\n[28]  [ self-published source] A few years later, despite the incident with the \"Little Rock Nine\", Faubus ran as a moderate segregationist against Dale Alford, who was challenging Faubus for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1962.\nLittle Rock Nine Memorial\nMemorial closeup of Eckford\nLegacy\nExternal video\nBooknotes interview with Melba Patillo Beals on Warriors Don't Cry, November 27, 1994, C-SPANA commemorative silver dollar\nMemorial at Arkansas State Capitol\nThree members of the \"Little Rock Nine\" (L-R) Ernest Green, Carlotta Walls La\nNier, and Terrence Roberts - stand together on the steps of the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014Little Rock Central High School still functions as part of the Little Rock School District, and is now a National Historic Site that houses a Civil Rights Museum, administered in partnership with the National Park Service, to commemorate the events of 1957.\n[29] The Daisy Bates House, home to Daisy Bates, then the president of the Arkansas NAACP and a focal point for the students, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001 for its role in the episode.\n[30]In 1958, Cuban poet Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n published \"Little Rock\", a bilingual composition in English and Spanish denouncing the racial segregation in the United States.\n[31]Melba Pattillo Beals wrote a memoir titled Warriors Don't Cry, published in the mid-1990s.\nTwo made-for-television movies have depicted the events of the crisis: the 1981 CBS movie Crisis at Central High, and the 1993 Disney Channel movie The Ernest Green Story.\nIn 1996, seven of the Little Rock Nine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show.\nThey came face to face with a few of the white students who had tormented them as well as one student who had befriended them.\nPresident Bill Clinton honored the Little Rock Nine in November 1999 when he presented them each with a Congressional Gold Medal.\nThe medal is the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress.\n[32] It is given to those who have provided outstanding service to the country.\nTo receive the Congressional Gold Medal, recipients must be co-sponsored by two-thirds of both the House and Senate.\nIn 2007, the United States Mint made available a commemorative silver dollar to \"recognize and pay tribute to the strength, the determination and the courage displayed by African-American high school students in the fall of 1957.\"\nThe obverse depicts students accompanied by a soldier, with nine stars symbolizing the Little Rock Nine.\nThe reverse depicts an image of Little Rock Central High School, c. 1957.\nProceeds from the coin sales are to be used to improve the National Historic Site.\nOn December 9, 2008, the Little Rock Nine were invited to attend the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama, the first African-American to be elected President of the United States.\n[33]On February 9, 2010, Marquette University honored the group by presenting them with the P\u00e8re Marquette Discovery Award, the university's highest honor, one that had previously been given to Mother Teresa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Karl Rahner, and the Apollo 11 astronauts, among other notables.\nSee also\nBlack school\nFables of Faubus, a song written by jazz bassist Charles Mingus\nLittle Rock (poem)Nine from Little Rock, an Academy Award-winning documentary film about the Little Rock Nine\nStand in the Schoolhouse Door\nWomen's Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools\nFootnotes^ Brown v.

Johnson, DC on Sun, Jan 02, 2011Find me on: Facebook Linked\nIn Twitter Google+Tweet\nThyroid problems, especially hypothyroidism can alter blood fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides.\nThe published evidence is quite clear in documenting that the actual total cholesterol level itself is not the most important risk factor of cardiovascular disease.\nIt is the ratio between the level of HDL-\"goo d\" cholesterol and total cholesterol that we need to be concerned about.\nTherefore, in adults, the HDL-\"good\" cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio should be higher than 0.24  (just divide your HDL level by your cholesterol).\nOr more precisely, the HDL/total cholesterol ratio:0.24 or higher is considered idealunder 0.24 - lowless than 0.10 - very dangerous.\nGenerally speaking, the higher the ratio, the better  (the lower your risk of a heart attack).\nHowever, HDL is closely related to triglycerides.\nIt appears common for people with high triglycerides to have low HDL's, and these same people also tend to have high levels of clotting factors in their blood stream, which is unhealthy in protecting against heart disease.\nTherefore, in adults, the triglyceride/HDL-\"good\" cholesterol ratio should be below 2 (just divide your triglycerides level by your HDL).\nOr more precisely, the triglyceride/HDL ratio:2 or less is considered ideal4 - high6 - much too high\nAnd, since HDL (high density lipoprotein) is protective against heart disease, the lower the ratio, the better.\nIn other words, the lower your triglycerides, or the higher your HDL, the smaller this ratio becomes.\nIt is now believed that the triglycerides/HDL ratio is one of the most potent predictors of heart disease.\nA Harvard-lead study author reported:\"High triglycerides alone increased the risk of heart attack nearly three-fold.\nAnd people with the highest ratio of triglycerides to HDL -- the \"good\" cholesterol -- had 16 times the risk of heart attack as those with the lowest ratio of triglycerides to HDL in the study of 340 heart attack patients and 340 of their healthy, same age counterparts.\nThe citation stated, the ratio of triglycerides to HDL was the strongest predictor of a heart attack, even more accurate than the LDL/HDL ratio.\nIf you found value in this article, please use the social sharing icons at the top of this post and please share with those you know who are still suffering with low thyroid symptoms despite having medical managment.\nThank you, help me reach more people so they may regain their zest for living!All the best \u2013 Dr. Johnson \u2013 Digging Deeper To Find Solutions\nSupporting Citation:\nGaziano JM, Hennekens CH, O'Donnell CJ, Breslow JL, Buring JE.\nFasting triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and risk of myocardial infarction.\nCirculation.\n1997 Oct 21;96 (8):2520-5.\nTopics: Hypothyroidism , thyroid symptoms , cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL , Heart Disease\nIria de Cella\nNovember 21, 2011 10:05:05 AM PSTSo, why doctors say anything about HDL colesterol?\nReply to Iria de Cella\nDr. Karl R.\nO.\nS.

    "document": "How is physics used in forensic science? Forensic scientists examine the physical evidence gathered at crime scenes to help determine the nature of a crime and if there is any evidence indicating who committed it.\nMuch of forensic science is dependent upon chemistry and the analysis of chemical compositions, but what is lesser known is how the forensic scientist makes use of physics in his regular investigation of crime evidence.\nScience Used in Forensics\nForensic scientists need to have a strong grounding in many different fields of science and must understand how they interrelate to one another.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, forensic investigators and scientists need to have a strong grounding in both math and science and should obtain either an associate's or bachelor's degree in some field of science.\nDegree programs should be heavily steeped in laboratory work and hands-on application of science like physics.\nBallistic Evidence\nAnother important use of physics in the work of the forensic scientist is in the study of ballistics.\nBallistic evidence can sometimes be used to determine the trajectory of a bullet and its potential impact on the item it strikes, whether it be a person or an object.\nForensic scientists need to understand how force and trajectory impact an object that is struck.\nUnderstanding different projectiles and their potential impact makes it possible to understand what weapon was used and from where it was used as well.\nInfrared Spectromicroscopy\nAnother way in which the discipline of physics is important for the forensic scientist to know is in the analysis of evidence that is too microscopic to analyze through chemical analysis.\nForensic scientists make use of infrared spectromicroscopy as a means of investigation for microscopic particles.\nThis scientific technique involves using infrared photons to determine a particle's vibrational mode.\nSince different substances have unique vibrations, forensic scientists can use this information to analyze crime scene evidence.\nCrime Scene Reconstruction\nCrime scene reconstruction is heavily dependent upon the discipline of physics.\nCrime scenes often appear to be a chaotic mess of evidence.\nCrime scene investigators can use physics, however, to understand exactly how a crime took place.\nIn some cases this is through ballistics analysis, but there are often more factors to consider than just the trajectory of a bullet.\nInstead, blood splatter analysis can be used to determine useful information about the crime as can the the other evidence found at the scene.\nIf a struggle ensued, physics can help indicate the severity of the struggle.\nIn crimes where multiple perpetrators are present, but not evidently so, physics can help reveal this to be the case based on the crime scene reconstruction.479 Views \u00b7 View Upvoters\n\n",

    "document": "Knee Wraps Help Your Lift, But Harm Your Knees Knee Wraps Help Your Lift, But Harm Your Knees\nJoshua Wortman\nCoach\nBodybuilding, Supplements, Nutrition, Strength Training\nShare Tweet\nThe back squat is commonly deemed the king of lower body exercises, and many lifters rely on knee wraps to protect their knees when squatting due to the heavy loads that are involved.\nKnee wraps are also worn to gain mechanical advantage during the squat.\nThere is evidence supporting the notion that wearing knee wraps enables athletes to lift more weight or perform more reps than they could without them.\nHowever, according to a new study, wearing knee wraps during squatting may not be the best idea.\nThis study investigated the effects of wearing knee wraps on mechanical output and performance characteristics of the back squat.\nTen resistance trained men participated in the study.\nAll had squat experience and had squatted with knee wraps, although they did not use them regularly.\nThe study was divided into two sessions that were 7 days apart.\nSession 1 was used to determine the 1-rep max (1RM) in the back squat.\nIn session 2, each lifter performed 6 single back squats with 80% of their 1RM.\n3 of the lifts were performed with knee wraps, and the other 3 were performed without them.\nThe knee wrapping technique used was known as the \"Figure of Eight\" method used by Harman and Frykman.\n1The results of the study revealed that wearing knee wraps during the back squat resulted in a 39% reduction in horizontal barbell displacement that continued during the lifting phase.\nThe lowering phase vertical impulse remained within 1% whether the knees were wrapped or unwrapped.\nHowever, the lowering phase was performed 45% faster.\nThis indicated that vertical force during the lowering phase was significantly larger and was likely a result of the generation and storage of elastic energy in the knee wrap.\nSubsequent vertical impulse was 10% greater as well.\nThe mechanical work involved in vertically displacing the center of mass was performed 20% faster and resulted in a 10% increase in peak power.\n2The results of this study indicate that the elastic properties of knee wraps actually increased mechanical output during the squat, but it altered the technique in such a fashion that is likely to change the muscles targeted by the exercise and possibly compromise the knee joint.\n3When the pros and cons of wearing knee wraps are measured, it is concluded that wraps should not be worn when squatting during the strength and condition process.\nIf you think you have weakness in the knees, the knee joint should be assessed and treated instead of wearing wraps and possibly jeopardizing knee health.\nFor those of you looking to compete in powerlifting, now you know exactly what your wraps are doing for you.\nPhoto courtesy of Shutterstock.\nTopic: Fitness\nSee more about: strength training, powerlifting, knee wrap\nComments Next Article\nBreaking Muscle Newsletter\nGet updates and special offers delivered directly to your inbox.\n\n",

for 'abode of snow'Geography: The Himalayas stretch across the northeastern portion of India.\nThey cover approximately 1,500 mi (2,400 km) and pass through the nations of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Bhutan and Nepal.\nThe Himalayan range is made up of three parallel ranges often referred to as the Greater Himalayas, the Lesser Himalayas, and the Outer Himalayas.\nEcology: While intimidating mountains like Everest and 2K tend to dominate our perceptions of the region, the Himalayas are rich in biodiversity.\nClimates range from tropical at the base of the mountains to perennial snow and ice at the highest elevations.\nThese complex and diverse eco-regions are interconnected: an ecological threat to one is ultimately a threat to many.\nHere are just a few examples of Himalayan ecology:\nMontane Grasslands and Shrublands: Western alpine shrubs and meadows can be found between 9,850 and 16,400 ft.\nThese areas tend to have cold winters and mild summers that allow for plant growth.\nRhododendron plants cover the lower shrublands, while the alpine meadows, directly above, host a range of flora in the warmer months.\nAnimals found in this region include the snow leopard, Himalayan tahr, musk deer, and pikas.\nTemperate Coniferous Forest: In the northeast, temperate sub-alpine conifer forests are found at elevations of 8,200 to 13,800 ft.\nLocated in the inner valley area, these forests are protected from harsh monsoon conditions by surrounding mountain ranges.\nThe dominant tree types are pine, hemlock, spruce, and fir.\nAnimals found in this region include red pandas, takins, and musk deer.\nTemperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests: Found in middle elevations of 6,600 to 9,800 ft. in the eastern region are broadleaf and coniferous forests.\nThese forests receive almost 80 inches of annual rainfall, mostly during the monsoon season.\nIn addition to indigenous oaks and maples, plants like orchids, lichen, and ferns also grow in the area.\nA huge range of wildlife, including over 500 species of birds, are found here during the cooler seasons before they migrate to higher elevations to escape the hot summers.\nThis is also the primary home for golden langur monkeys.\nTropical and Sub-tropical Broadleaf Forests: Located at 1,650 to 3,300 ft. along a narrow strip of the outer Himalayan range are the Himalayan sub-tropical broadleaf forests.\nHere there is a wide range of plant life thanks to the areas varied topography, soil types, and rainfall levels.\nForest types include subtropical dry evergreen, northern dry mixed deciduous forests, moist mixed deciduous forests, subtropical broadleaf forests, northern tropical semi-evergreen forests, and northern tropical wet evergreen forests.\nWildlife includes many threatened species including tigers and Asian elephants.\nMore than 340 different species of birds can be found in this region.\nHighest peak: Mount Everest at 29,029 ft (8,848 m) is not only the highest peak in the Himalayas, but the highest peak on the entire planet.\nOther famous peaks include Karakora (K2), Kailash, Kanchenjunga, Nanga Parbat, Annapurna, and Manasklu.\nRivers: The Himalayas are the source for the Indus, the Yangtze and the Ganga-Brahmaputra.\nAll three are major river systems for the continent of Asia.\nThe main rivers sourced in Himalayas are the Ganges, Indus, Yarlung, Yangtze, Yellow, Mekong, and Nujiang.\nGlaciers: The Himalayas are the third largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after Antarctica and the Arctic.\nThere are approximately 15,000 glaciers located throughout the range.\nAt 48 miles (72 km) in length, the Himalayan Siachen glacier is the largest glacier outside the poles.\nOther notable glaciers located in the Himalayas include the Baltoro, Biafo, Nubra, and Hispur.\nAdditional Facts:\nThe Himalayas are the result of tectonic plate motions that collided India into Tibet.\nBecause of the great amount of tectonic motion still occurring at the site, the Himalayas have a proportionally high number of earthquakes and tremors.\nThe Himalayas are one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet.\nThe range affects air and water circulation systems, impacting the weather conditions in the region.\nThe Himalayas cover approximately 75% of Nepal.\nServing as a natural barrier for tens of thousands of years, the range prevented early interactions between the people of India and the people of China and Mongolia.\nMt.\nEverest was named after Colonel Sir George Everest, a British surveyor who was based in India during the early-to-mid-nineteenth century.\nThe Nepalese call Mt.\nEverest \"Samgarmatha\" which can be translated as \"Goddess of the Universe\" or \"Forehead of the Sky.\"In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay were the first people to successfully climb to the summit of Everest.\nDespite its name, the Snow Leopard \u2013 a Himalayan local \u2013 is actually most closely related to the Tiger.\n\n",

    "document": "Why doesn't Wi-Fi calling work on the iPhone 5? Something changed in beta\nWhy doesn't Wi-Fi calling work on the i\nPhone 5?\nPeter Cohen26 Sep 201463i\nOS 8 was released on September 17th and millions of i\nOS device users upgraded.\nThat included i\nPhone 5 owners on T-Mobile who hoped to use Wi-Fi calling, only to find out their phones aren't supported.\nWhat's going on?\nWhat's Wi-Fi calling?\nWi-Fi calling enables the i\nPhone to make and receive phone calls over Wi-Fi, instead of having to depend on a signal from a nearby cell tower.\nFor many T-Mobile customers this is a godsend; the company's cell network does a notoriously poor job of penetrating buildings and working in rural areas, because of the GSM radio frequencies T-Mobile uses.\nWi-Fi calling has been supported by other non-i\nOS smartphones sold by T-Mobile for some time, but with the addition of the feature to the i\nPhone, T-Mobile has upped the stakes: It's begun advertising Wi-Fi calling heavily, and says all the smartphones it currently sells supports the feature.\nT-Mobile has even started offering a \"Personal Cell\nSpot\" device \u2014 a 802.11ac Wi-Fi router especially enhanced to prioritize Wi-Fi calls \u2014 to customers looking to maximize their call quality.\nWi-Fi calling is also coming to customers of EE in the U.\nK. It's coming to other carriers too, but T-Mobile is the first to offer the feature.\nHow to use Wi-Fi calling with i\nOS 8Disappearing feature\nWi-Fi calling works on the i\nPhone 5c, 5s, i\nPhone 6, and i\nPhone 6 Plus, but the i\nPhone 5 has been left out.\nLeft out, that is, of the general public release of i\nOS 8.\nBecause Wi-Fi calling worked on the i\nPhone 5, for T-Mobile customers who had access to i\nOS 8 betas.\nWi-Fi calling was added to i\nOS 8 beta 3, which was released in early July.\nBetween then and now, Apple removed Wi-Fi calling support in i\nOS 8 for the i\nPhone 5 model.\nThe i\nPhone 5 is the first i\nPhone model T-Mobile sold and officially supported.\nAdding to T-Mobile users' frustration is that their customer service and tech support staff routinely told them both before and after i\nOS 8's release that the i\nPhone 5 did support Wi-Fi calling.\nIn fact, I verified this: Earlier this week I called T-Mobile customer service and tech help.\nWhen I inquired about Wi-Fi calling, reps in both departments assured me the i\nPhone 5 was supported.\nThere was also widespread confusion about this on T-Mobile's support forums.\nApple has posted a Knowledgebase article explaining Wi-Fi calling in greater detail.\nNo mention is made of the i\nPhone 5 anywhere in the document.\nWi-Fi calling is available for T-Mobile in the United States.\nYou need an i\nPhone 5s, i\nPhone 5c, i\nPhone 6, or i\nPhone 6 Plus.\nYour device needs to be using i\nOS 8 and have a Wi-Fi Internet connection.\nI asked T-Mobile PR for an explanation.\nHere's what they had to say.\nYou need an i\nPhone 5s, i\nPhone 5c, or later using i\nOS 8 to use Wi-Fi calling and texting on T-Mobile.\nUltimately, each device manufacturer determines what features to include in their devices.\nBut why?\nWe're unlikely to get a straight answer from anyone on the record about why Wi-Fi calling doesn't work with the i\nPhone 5 in the public release of i\nOS 8.\nI am reluctant to speculate too wildly about what happened between i\nOS 8 beta 3 and now.\nSometimes features and functionality are exposed in beta software that don't make it into the final release, for whatever reason.\nWhat's more, T-Mobile came on board with the i\nPhone more than mid-way through the i\nPhone 5's run \u2014 Apple updated the i\nPhone 5 with support for T-Mobile's network shortly before the i\nPhone 5 went on sale at T-Mobile stores in April, 2013.\n(I've written before about the hoops I had to jump through to get my i\nPhone 5 working right on T-Mobile's network.\n)I don't want to call the i\nPhone 5 an edge case for T-Mobile, but I suspect its population of i\nPhone 5 users is significantly smaller than users of more recent models which do support Wi-Fi calling.\nBottom line\nAs it stands now, if you're on T-Mobile and want to use Wi-Fi calling, you'll need an i\nPhone 5C or later, plain and simple.\nSo if you have an i\nPhone 5, it's one incentive to upgrade to a newer model.\nEven though you can't get Wi-Fi calling to work on your i\nPhone 5, T-Mobile may be willing to work with you in other ways to improve your indoor reception.\nThey offer a 4G LTE booster that can dramatically improve reception in your house, for example \u2014 I've used one for months (with an i\nPhone 5S and i\nPhone 5), and I went from one spotty bar in the house to four solid bars most of the time.\nT-Mobile's Personal Cell\nSpot, Wi-Fi Calling, and 4G LTE Booster explained\nAre you an i\nPhone 5 user on T-Mobile?\nFrustrated by the lack of Wi-Fi calling?\nUsing this as an excuse to upgrade?\nSound off in the comments!View Comments (63)Opinion Wi-Fi\n\n",

What Does Nitrogen Do For Your Lawn\nBy Allyn Paul, filed under Lawn Tips.\nIf you want your lawn to be green, then you need to give it nitrogen.\nIn fact, nitrogen is the primary element found in most lawn fertilizers.\nKeep in mind that lawn fertilizer is NOT lawn food.\nGrass and other plants make their own food (in the form of sugars) through the process of photosynthesis.\nLawn nutrients like potassium, phosphorus and, yes, nitrogen, support the process of photosynthesis.\nIn short, nitrogen is what makes your grass green, and the greener the grass, the more photosynthesis can occur and the thicker the lawn gets.\nBut be careful!Too much nitrogen can create big problems for your lawn.\nFirst off, too much nitrogen causes the lawn to overgrow, meaning you may have to cut it two or three times per week.\nIf you don't, then the turf gets too long and when you do cut, you stress it out.\nThat's not good.\nIn addition, with too much nitrogen and too much top growth, the lawn's root system cannot support the vigor of the plants.\nIf the roots cannot support the top, they get stressed and thin out even more.\nIt's like a child who eats too much candy and then crashes out to sleep after a couple hours of frenzied energy.\nHow much nitrogen?\nAs a basic rule, I recommend 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of lawn in the spring, and another pound in the fall.\nDuring the summer you can apply very slow release organics to your grass just to give it a nice, long feeding.\nSimple!____________________________________________________________Wondering \"what to\" put on your lawn and \"when to\" put it down?\nGet my $7 Step By Step ebook and learn it!\nI am really proud of the results my readers are getting using this easy to follow lawn treatment schedule .\nLawn Care Step\nYou can start at ANY time during the year...\nI wrote the book so it is easy to get into lawn care no matter what time it is...

    "document": "Whiteout (weather) Whiteout snow squall northwest of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada February 27, 2014Whiteout in Saskatchewan\nWhiteout is a weather condition in which visibility and contrast are severely reduced by snow or sand.\nThe horizon disappears completely and there are no reference points at all, leaving the individual with a distorted orientation.\nWhiteout has been defined as: \"A condition of diffuse light when no shadows are cast, due to a continuous white cloud layer appearing to merge with the white snow surface.\nNo surface irregularities of the snow are visible, but a dark object may be clearly seen.\nThere is no visible horizon.\"\n[1]A whiteout may be due simply to extremely heavy snowfall rates as seen in lake effect conditions, or to other factors such as diffuse lighting from overcast clouds, mist or fog, or a background of snow.\nPeople can be lost in their own front yards during a true whiteout, when the door is only 10 feet (3 meters) away,  [ citation needed] and they would have to feel their way back.\nMotorists have to stop their cars where they are, as the road is impossible to see.\nNormal snowfalls and blizzards, where snow is falling at 1 or 2 inches per hour (2.5 or 5.1 cm/h), or where the relief visibility is not clear yet having a clear field of view for over 30 feet (9 meters), are often incorrectly called whiteouts.\nContents [ hide ]1 Types2 Variations3 Hazards4 See also5 References\nTypes  [ edit]There are three different forms of a whiteout:\nIn blizzard conditions, snow already on the ground can become windblown, reducing visibility to near zero.\nIn snowfall conditions, the volume of snow falling may obscure objects reducing visibility to near zero.\nAn example of this is during lake-effect snow or mountain-effect snow, where the volume of snow can be many times greater than normal snows or blizzards.\nWhere ground-level thick fog exists in a snow-covered environment, especially on open areas devoid of features.\nVariations  [ edit]A whiteout should not be confused with flat-light.\nWhilst there are similarities, both the causes and effects are different.\nA whiteout is a reduction and scattering of sunlight.\n[2]Cause: Sunlight is blocked, reduced and scattered by ice crystals in falling snow, wind-blown spin-drift, water droplets in low-lying clouds or localised fog, etc.\nThe remaining scattered light is merged and blended.\nResult: Due to a reduction in reflected light, visual references e.g.\nthe horizon, terrain features, slope aspect, etc.\nare significantly reduced or completely blocked.\nThis leads an inability to position yourself relative to the surroundings.\nIn severe conditions an individual may experience a loss of kinesthesia  (ability to discern position and movement), confusion, loss of balance and an overall reduction in the ability to operate.\nFlat-light on Ekstr\u00f6m Shelf Ice, Antarctica\nFlat-light is a diffusion of sunlight.\n[3]Cause: Sunlight is both scattered and diffused by atmospheric particles (e.g.\nwater molecules, ice crystals) plus ground laying snow causing light to be received from multiple directions.\nCommonly, the effect is increased during a whiteout and/or later in the day when the sun drops towards the horizon, due to sunlight passing through the atmosphere for a greater distance.\nResult: Light is received from multiple directions with each light source producing overlapping shadows which cancel-out each other.\nThis dulls the area and removes indicators such as tones and contrast, making it difficult to discern similarly coloured slope features.\nThe loss of visual indicators of shape and edge detail results in objects and features seeming to blend into each other, producing a flat featureless vista.\nAn effect of visual blending may be a loss of depth of field resulting in disorientation.\nHazards  [ edit]Whiteout conditions pose threats to mountain climbers, skiers, aviation, and mobile ground traffic.\nMotorists, especially those on large high-speed routes, are also at risk.\nThere have been many major multiple-vehicle collisions associated with whiteout conditions.\nOne motorist may come to a complete stop when he or she cannot see the road, while the motorist behind is still moving.\nLocal, short-duration whiteout conditions can be created artificially in the vicinity of airports and helipads due to aircraft operations.\nSnow on the ground can be stirred up by helicopter rotor down-wash or airplane jet blast, presenting hazards to both aircraft and bystanders on the ground.\nSee also  [ edit]Air New Zealand Flight 901, an air accident on Mount Erebus, Antarctica in 1979 caused in part by whiteout conditions.\nBlack ice\nReferences  [ edit]^ The Crossing of Antarctica by Sir Vivian Fuchs and Sir Edmund Hillary  (Glossary, page 296) Cassell, London, 1958^ http://www.brentaski.com/blog/what-colour-ski-googles-is-best.html^ http://www.brentaski.com/blog/what-colour-ski-googles-is-best.html\n\n",

    "document": "The Black Death: Bubonic Plague The Black Death: Bubonic Plague\nIn the early 1330s an outbreak of deadly bubonic plague occurred in China.\nThe bubonic plague mainly affects rodents, but fleas can transmit the disease to people.\nOnce people are infected, they infect others very rapidly.\nPlague causes fever and a painful swelling of the lymph glands called buboes, which is how it gets its name.\nThe disease also causes spots on the skin that are red at first and then turn black.\nSince China was one of the busiest of the world's trading nations, it was only a matter of time before the outbreak of plague in China spread to western Asia and Europe.\nIn October of 1347, several Italian merchant ships returned from a trip to the Black Sea, one of the key links in trade with China.\nWhen the ships docked in Sicily, many of those on board were already dying of plague.\nWithin days the disease spread to the city and the surrounding countryside.\nAn eyewitness tells what happened:\"Realizing what a deadly disaster had come to them, the people quickly drove the Italians from their city.\nBut the disease remained, and soon death was everywhere.\nFathers abandoned their sick sons.\nLawyers refused to come and make out wills for the dying.\nFriars and nuns were left to care for the sick, and monasteries and convents were soon deserted, as they were stricken, too.\nBodies were left in empty houses, and there was no one to give them a Christian burial.\n\"The disease struck and killed people with terrible speed.\nThe Italian writer Boccaccio said its victims often\"ate lunch with their friends and dinner with their ancestors in paradise.\n\"By the following August, the plague had spread as far north as England, where people called it \"The Black Death\" because of the black spots it produced on the skin.\nA terrible killer was loose across Europe, and Medieval medicine had nothing to combat it.\nIn winter the disease seemed to disappear, but only because fleas--which were now helping to carry it from person to person--are dormant then.\nEach spring, the plague attacked again, killing new victims.\nAfter five years 25 million people were dead-- one-third of Europe's people.\nEven when the worst was over, smaller outbreaks continued, not just for years, but for centuries.\nThe survivors lived in constant fear of the plague's return, and the disease did not disappear until the 1600s.\nMedieval society never recovered from the results of the plague.\nSo many people had died that there were serious labor shortages all over Europe.\nThis led workers to demand higher wages, but landlords refused those demands.\nBy the end of the 1300s peasant revolts broke out in England, France, Belgium and Italy.\nThe disease took its toll on the church as well.\nPeople throughout Christendom had prayed devoutly for deliverance from the plague.\nWhy hadn't those prayers been answered?\nA new period of political turmoil and philosophical questioning lay ahead.\nBlack Death - Disaster Strikes25 million people died in just under five years between 1347 and 1352.\nEstimated population of Europe from 1000 to 1352.1000 38 million1100 48 million1200 59 million1300 70 million1347 75 million1352 50 million\nFor more information about the plague on this site, see:\nBlack Death Spreads\nBubonic Plague: Will it Ever End?\nI Saw the Black Death\nThe Medieval Miracles of Healing -- Medical Science\nThe Plague: an account from Boccaccio's The Decameron\nAdditional site on the plague:\nMaps by Eye\nWitness to History - historical information and maps provided by Eye\nWitness to History\nPlague and Public Health in Renaissance Europe\nFleas - site about the insects responsible for the Black Death\nRelated Links:\nThe Middle Ages\nPeople of the Middle Ages\nThe Crusades\nCathedrals\n\n",

search\"Macromolecules\" redirects here.\nFor the journal, see Macromolecules (journal).\n\"Macromolecular chemistry\" redirects here.\nFor the journal formerly known as Macromolecular Chemistry, see Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics.\nChemical structure of a polypeptide macromolecule\nA macromolecule is a very large molecule, such as protein, commonly created by the polymerization of smaller subunits ( monomers ).\nThey are typically composed of thousands of atoms or more.\nThe most common macromolecules in biochemistry are biopolymers  ( nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) and large non-polymeric molecules (such as lipids and macrocycles ).\n[1] Synthetic macromolecules include common plastics and synthetic fibers as well as experimental materials such as carbon nanotubes.\n[2]  [3]Contents [ hide ]1 Definition2 Properties3 Linear biopolymers3.1 Structural features3.1.1 DNA is optimised for encoding information3.1.2 Proteins are optimised for catalysis3.1.3 RNA is multifunctional4 Branched biopolymers5 Synthetic macromolecules6 See also7 References8 External links\nDefinition  [ edit]IUPAC definition\nMacromolecule\nLarge molecule\nA molecule of high relative molecular mass, the structure of which essentially comprises the multiple repetition of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass.\nNotes1.\nIn many cases, especially for synthetic polymers, a molecule can be regarded as having a high relative molecular mass if the addition or removal of one or a few of the units has a negligible effect on the molecular properties.\nThis statement fails in the case of certain macromolecules for which the properties may be critically dependent on fine details of the molecular structure.2.\nIf a part or the whole of the molecule fits into this definition, it may be described as either macromolecular or polymeric, or by polymer used adjectivally.\n[4]The term macromolecule  ( macro- + molecule) was coined by Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger in the 1920s, although his first relevant publication on this field only mentions high molecular compounds  (in excess of 1,000 atoms).\n[5] At that time the phrase polymer, as introduced by Berzelius in 1833, had a different meaning from that of today: it simply was another form of isomerism for example with benzene and acetylene and had little to do with size.\n[6]Usage of the term to describe large molecules varies among the disciplines.\nFor example, while biology refers to macromolecules as the four large molecules comprising living things, in chemistry, the term may refer to aggregates of two or more molecules held together by intermolecular forces rather than covalent bonds but which do not readily dissociate.\n[7]According to the standard IUPAC definition, the term macromolecule as used in polymer science refers only to a single molecule.\nFor example, a single polymeric molecule is appropriately described as a \"macromolecule\" or \"polymer molecule\" rather than a \"polymer,\" which suggests a substance composed of macromolecules.\n[8]Because of their size, macromolecules are not conveniently described in terms of stoichiometry alone.\nThe structure of simple macromolecules, such as homopolymers, may be described in terms of the individual monomer subunit and total molecular mass.\nComplicated biomacromolecules, on the other hand, require multi-faceted structural description such as the hierarchy of structures used to describe proteins.\nIn British English, the word \"macromolecule\" tends to be called \" high polymer \".\nProperties  [ edit]This section needs additional citations for verification.\nPlease help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources.\nUnsourced material may be challenged and removed.\n(May 2013)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Macromolecules often have unusual physical properties that do not occur for smaller molecules.\nFor example, DNA in a solution can be broken simply by sucking the solution through an ordinary straw because the physical forces on the molecule can overcome the strength of its covalent bonds.\nThe 1964 edition of Linus Pauling 's College Chemistry asserted that DNA in nature is never longer than about 5,000 base pairs.\n[9] This error arose because biochemists were inadvertently breaking their samples into fragments.\nIn fact, the DNA of chromosomes can be hundreds of millions of base pairs long, packaged into chromatin.\nAnother common macromolecular property that does not characterize smaller molecules is their relative insolubility in water and similar solvents, instead forming colloids.\nMany require salts or particular ions to dissolve in water.\nSimilarly, many proteins will denature if the solute concentration of their solution is too high or too low.\nHigh concentrations of macromolecules in a solution can alter the rates and equilibrium constants of the reactions of other macromolecules, through an effect known as macromolecular crowding.\n[10] This comes from macromolecules excluding other molecules from a large part of the volume of the solution, thereby increasing the effective concentrations of these molecules.\nLinear biopolymers  [ edit]All living organisms are dependent on three essential biopolymers for their biological functions: DNA, RNA and proteins.\n[11] Each of these molecules is required for life since each plays a distinct, indispensable role in the cell.\n[12] The simple summary is that DNA makes RNA, and then RNA makes proteins.\nDNA, RNA, and proteins all consist of a repeating structure of related building blocks ( nucleotides in the case of DNA and RNA, amino acids in the case of proteins).\nIn general, they are all unbranched polymers, and so can be represented in the form of a string.\nIndeed, they can be viewed as a string of beads, with each bead representing a single nucleotide or amino acid monomer linked together through covalent chemical bonds into a very long chain.\nIn most cases, the monomers within the chain have a strong propensity to interact with other amino acids or nucleotides.\nIn DNA and RNA, this can take the form of Watson-Crick base pairs  (G-C and A-T or A-U), although many more complicated interactions can and do occur.\nStructural features  [ edit]DNA RNA Proteins\nEncodes genetic information Yes Yes No\nCatalyzes biological reactions No Yes Yes\nBuilding blocks (type) Nucleotides Nucleotides Amino acids\nBuilding blocks (number) 4 4 20Strandedness Double Single Single\nStructure Double helix Complex Complex\nStability to degradation High Variable Variable\nRepair systems Yes No No\nBecause of the double-stranded nature of DNA, essentially all of the nucleotides take the form of Watson-Crick base pairs between nucleotides on the two complementary strands of the double-helix.\nIn contrast, both RNA and proteins are normally single-stranded.\nTherefore, they are not constrained by the regular geometry of the DNA double helix, and so fold into complex three-dimensional shapes dependent on their sequence.\nThese different shapes are responsible for many of the common properties of RNA and proteins, including the formation of specific binding pockets, and the ability to catalyse biochemical reactions.\nDNA is optimised for encoding information  [ edit]DNA is an information storage macromolecule that encodes the complete set of instructions  (the genome) that are required to assemble, maintain, and reproduce every living organism.\n[13]DNA and RNA are both capable of encoding genetic information, because there are biochemical mechanisms which read the information coded within a DNA or RNA sequence and use it to generate a specified protein.\nOn the other hand, the sequence information of a protein molecule is not used by cells to functionally encode genetic information.\n[1]: 5DNA has three primary attributes that allow it to be far better than RNA at encoding genetic information.\nFirst, it is normally double-stranded, so that there are a minimum of two copies of the information encoding each gene in every cell.\nSecond, DNA has a much greater stability against breakdown than does RNA, an attribute primarily associated with the absence of the 2'-hydroxyl group within every nucleotide of DNA.\nThird, highly sophisticated DNA surveillance and repair systems are present which monitor damage to the DNA and repair the sequence when necessary.\nAnalogous systems have not evolved for repairing damaged RNA molecules.\nConsequently, chromosomes can contain many billions of atoms, arranged in a specific chemical structure.\nProteins are optimised for catalysis  [ edit]Proteins are functional macromolecules responsible for catalysing the biochemical reactions that sustain life.\n[1]: 3 Proteins carry out all functions of an organism, for example photosynthesis, neural function, vision, and movement.\n[14]The single-stranded nature of protein molecules, together with their composition of 20 or more different amino acid building blocks, allows them to fold in to a vast number of different three-dimensional shapes, while providing binding pockets through which they can specifically interact with all manner of molecules.\nIn addition, the chemical diversity of the different amino acids, together with different chemical environments afforded by local 3D structure, enables many proteins to act as enzymes, catalyzing a wide range of specific biochemical transformations within cells.\nIn addition, proteins have evolved the ability to bind a wide range of cofactors and coenzymes, smaller molecules that can endow the protein with specific activities beyond those associated with the polypeptide chain alone.\nRNA is multifunctional  [ edit]RNA is multifunctional, its primary function is to encode proteins, according to the instructions within a cell's DNA.\n[1]: 5 They control and regulate many aspects of protein synthesis in eukaryotes.\nRNA encodes genetic information that can be translated into the amino acid sequence of proteins, as evidenced by the messenger RNA molecules present within every cell, and the RNA genomes of a large number of viruses.\nThe single-stranded nature of RNA, together with tendency for rapid breakdown and a lack of repair systems means that RNA is not so well suited for the long-term storage of genetic information as is DNA.\nIn addition, RNA is a single-stranded polymer that can, like proteins, fold into a very large number of three-dimensional structures.\nSome of these structures provide binding sites for other molecules and chemically-active centers that can catalyze specific chemical reactions on those bound molecules.\nThe limited number of different building blocks of RNA (4 nucleotides vs >20 amino acids in proteins), together with their lack of chemical diversity, results in catalytic RNA ( ribozymes) being generally less-effective catalysts than proteins for most biological reactions.\nBranched biopolymers  [ edit]Raspberry ellagitannin, a tannin composed of core of glucose units surrounded by gallic acid esters and ellagic acid units\nCarbohydrate macromolecules ( polysaccharides) are formed from polymers of monosaccharides.\n[1]: 11 Because monosaccharides have multiple functional groups, polysaccharides can form linear polymers (e.g.\ncellulose) or complex branched structures (e.g.\nglycogen ).\nPolysaccharides perform numerous roles in living organisms, acting as energy stores (e.g.\nstarch) and as structural components (e.g.\nchitin in arthropods and fungi).\nMany carbohydrates contain modified monosaccharide units that have had functional groups replaced or removed.\nPolyphenols consist of a branched structure of multiple phenolic subunits.\nThey can perform structural roles (e.g.\nlignin) as well as roles as secondary metabolites involved in signalling, pigmentation and defense.\nSynthetic macromolecules  [ edit]Structure of a polyphenylene dendrimer macromolecule reported by M\u00fcllen, et al.\n[15]Some examples of macromolecules are synthetic polymers ( plastics, synthetic fibers, and synthetic rubber ), graphene, and carbon nanotubes.\nPolymers may be prepared from inorganic matter as well as for instance in inorganic polymers and geopolymers.\nThe incorporation of inorganic elements enables the tunability of properties and/or responsive behavior as for instance in smart inorganic polymers.\nSee also  [ edit]List of

    "document": "Overview Print\nOverview\nA personality disorder is a type of mental disorder in which you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, functioning and behaving.\nA person with a personality disorder has trouble perceiving and relating to situations and people.\nThis causes significant problems and limitations in relationships, social activities, work and school.\nIn some cases, you may not realize that you have a personality disorder because your way of thinking and behaving seems natural to you.\nAnd you may blame others for the challenges you face.\nPersonality disorders usually begin in the teenage years or early adulthood.\nThere are many types of personality disorders.\nSome types may become less obvious throughout middle age.\nSymptoms\nTypes of personality disorders are grouped into three clusters, based on similar characteristics and symptoms.\nMany people with one personality disorder also have signs and symptoms of at least one additional personality disorder.\nIt's not necessary to exhibit all the signs and symptoms listed for a disorder to be diagnosed.\nCluster A personality disorders\nCluster A personality disorders are characterized by odd, eccentric thinking or behavior.\nThey include paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder.\nParanoid personality

disorder, see your doctor or other primary care professional or a mental health professional.\nUntreated, personality disorders can cause significant problems in your life that may get worse without treatment.\nRequest an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\nCauses\nPersonality is the combination of thoughts, emotions and behaviors that makes you unique.\nIt's the way you view, understand and relate to the outside world, as well as how you see yourself.\nPersonality forms during childhood, shaped through an interaction of:\nYour genes.\nCertain personality traits may be passed on to you by your parents through inherited genes.\nThese traits are sometimes called your temperament.\nYour environment.\nThis involves the surroundings you grew up in, events that occurred, and relationships with family members and others.\nPersonality disorders are thought to be caused by a combination of these genetic and environmental influences.\nYour genes may make you vulnerable to developing a personality disorder, and a life situation may trigger the actual development.\nRisk factors\nAlthough the precise cause of personality disorders is not known, certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering personality disorders, including:\nFamily history of personality disorders or other mental illness\nAbusive, unstable or chaotic family life during childhood\nBeing diagnosed with childhood conduct disorder\nVariations in brain chemistry and structure\nComplications\nPersonality disorders can significantly disrupt the lives of both the affected person and those who care about that person.\nPersonality disorders may cause problems with relationships, work or school, and can lead to social isolation or alcohol or drug abuse.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nRequest an

or $25,000 -$50,000 for up to a quarter mile.\nSlopes, curves, odd shapes and other complications add to the total cost, and smaller jobs aren't necessarily cheaper because it costs the contractor a minimum amount to haul the asphalt heater, steamroller and other equipment to the site.\nCosts can go as low as $1 -$2 a square foot or less, particularly for repaving work by door-to-door hustlers claiming they have \"left over\" asphalt in their truck and will install it cheaply; many experts caution against this, because the quality of the work may be substandard, there's no way to find the company after the work is done and the \"left over\" asphalt may have cooled off too much, which affects its durability and quality.\nWhat should be included:\nAsphalt requires professional equipment and a trained crew.\nIt can include removing topsoil and organic material or existing pavement; compacting the soil; installing geo-tech fabric if the soil is weak or drains poorly; laying a base; and applying 2\"-3\" of asphalt and compacting it.\nAsk\nThe\nBuilder.com offers tips on residential asphalt paving  [ 1] .\nWait about 24-48 hours before driving or parking on fresh asphalt (or longer if the weather is hot).\nHowever, it can take up to 12 months for asphalt to completely harden and cure.\nAn asphalt driveway can last 10-35 years, depending on the quality of the installation and maintenance.\nThe Family Handyman magazine explains factors that make an asphalt driveway durable  [ 2] .\nIf more than 55% to 60% of an old asphalt driveway contains wide or spiderweb cracks, sinkholes or potholes, it typically needs to be removed and replaced rather than repaved.\nAdditional costs:\nBecause a driveway connects to a public street, there may be local regulations governing the width of the driveway and the materials used to build it.\nA permit is typically required, and fees vary from nominal to pricey, depending on location.\nAn asphalt driveway should be sealed about six to eight months after installation, and again every 2-5 years.\nSome experts recommend sealing a driveway every year, depending on climate and other conditions.\nDo-it-yourself supplies can cost $50 -$200 depending on the size and condition of the driveway, and the quality of the sealer.\nProfessional driveway sealing can cost $200 -$500 or more.\nShopping for an asphalt driveway:\nAsphalt driveways are typically installed by asphalt or paving contractors (although general building or landscaping contractors may do this as part of a larger project, and sub out the asphalt work.\nThe Better Business Bureau lists tips for selecting an asphalt driveway contractor  [ 3] .\nGet several estimates; ask for and check references (if possible, visit a previous project); make sure the company is properly insured and licensed  [ 4] ; and check for any complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau  [ 5] .\nE-mail Post Tweet Comments (5)Cost\nHelper News7 Ways to Stretch Your Reduced Food Budget\nEnd of the year budgets are tight for everyone, especially in this economy.\nIt's especially hard for the millions of Americans who depend on government programs like food stamps to help make ends meet.\n|| Posted November 11 20137 Lesser-Known Discounts for the 50+ Crowd\nAs they age, members of the Baby Boomer generation don't like to admit that they're senior citizens, but they love getting discounts.\nIt's kind of a quandary, because some of the best deals available are reduced prices for older folks.|| Posted October 21 2013\u2023 All Cost\nHelper Blog Posts\nWhat People Are Paying - Recent Comments\nAsfault\nAmount: $3,000.00Posted by: a user in Sudbury, Other.\nPosted: February 8th, 2018 07:02PMSq Ft of Driveway: 12ft - 60ft Contractor:\nI want to build asfault driveways.\nWide 12' length 60' how much does it cost to build driveways\nWas this post helpful to you?\nyes no Report prohibited or spam\nAsphalt driveway\nAmount: $5,000.00Posted by: Toby Heine in Ashland City, TN.\nPosted: November 21st, 2016 02:11AMSq Ft of Driveway: 2200 Contractor: Dans paving &concrete\nTold me I would be getting a 10/150 drive and a 30/40 turn around.\nEnded up with an 8/100 drive and 25/30 turn around.\nThey stretched it so thin dout it will last two years.\nWhy do we fall for their scams with our hard earned money.\nWas this post helpful to you?\nyes no Report prohibited or spamnew asphalt driveway\nAmount: $4,000.00Posted by: Mss\nG in north platte, NE.\nPosted: September 1st, 2016 12:09PMSq Ft of Driveway: 4400 Contractor: Lovell Asphalt, Columbus, NELooks great, experienced crew of 6 total workers took about 5 hours total to grade gravel driveway, lay out 4 inch thick asphalt millings from local road, compact and oil.\nOnly time will tell how it holds up.\nHave not driven on yet.\nwill wait a couple days.\nGet a firm estimate before work starts.\nWas this post helpful to you?\nyes no Report prohibited or spam\nPaving over old asphalt\nAmount: $1,800.00Posted by: Greg huntwork in Union city, IN.\nPosted: April 21st, 2015 10:04AMSq Ft of Driveway: 110' x 12 Contractor:\nWas this post helpful to you?\nyes no Report prohibited or spam\nDriveway seal\nAmount: $2,400.00Posted by: linda Briel in prospect, VA.

    "document": "How plants respond to increasing carbon dioxide How plants respond to increasing carbon dioxide\nDownload audio show transcript\nSaturday 3 July 2010 12:14PM  (view full episode)As carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, plants become more efficient at producing their food and chemical requirements.\nThey can allocate more resources for defence against pests.\nThis is good for the plants but bad for the animals that eat them.\nPlants produce more toxins such as cyanide and it is thought the chemical composition of some leaves may make them unsuitable for animals which once relied on them as food.\nProtein is reduced and animals need to eat more leaves to maintain their level of proteins.\nRos Gleadow warns that changing the composition of the atmosphere has broader consequences than just climate change.\nThere are direct effects on plants, some of which don't grow so well under increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nTweet\nTranscript\nShow\nGuests\nRos Gleadow,Senior lecturer, School of Biological Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne.http://www.biolsci.monash.edu.au/staff/gleadow/index.html\nCredits\nPresenter Robyn Williams\nProducer David Fisher\nComments (4)Add your comment\nDave\nB :06 Jul 2010 9:39:02am\nOK, this is a segment on the possible negative effects of increased CO2 on plants, or more correctly humans.\nI'm sure there are many beneficial effects to plants caused by higher CO2 levels such as increased drought tolerance.\nLet's hear about some of the benefits rather than picking those cyanide laced cherries.\nReply Alert moderator\nCon Karavas :11 Jul 2010 2:27:03pm\nQuite right Dave\nB, it's not about fruit: it's about future generations and pumping greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.\nWill it be OK or no good?\nIf you're a climate changer and you're wrong - it will be expensive.\nIf climate changers are wrong we will be a little poorer (about 2% according to Abbott), however we will hand onto our Grandchildren and Future Generations a clean and healthy planet and ordered societies.\nIf you're a climate change denier or sceptic and you're wrong - it will not be pretty.\nIf the climate change sceptics are wrong we will hand onto our Grandchildren a world that, in a best case scenario, will be like in the Mad Max movie.\nBit of a no brainer really.\nAlert moderator\nHarvest :29 Dec 2013 2:16:35pm\nThe balance?\nBetter plant growth?\nFrom everything I have read elsewhere, plants only grow better for a short period of time.\nGrowth is ultimately limited by soil fertility and soil minerals.\nSo, you end up with higher toxins and less protein and not a lot more food.\nIn greenhouse experiments plants can be given, artificially, the amounts of water and nutrients they desire, and temperature can be controlled.\nHowever, out in the field, where most of our crops are grown this is much less the case for most of the world.\nAlert moderator\nTony\nM :09 Dec 2010 1:06:32pm\nYes lets consider benefits of increased CO2.\nThe point of this article is in my mind, no one thought there were any negatives to increased CO2 on plants.\nThis observation adds balance to other observations of positives growth improvements etc... Now you are demanding we consider other positives to balance this negative ?\nThe media is a place to be informed but I am not sure that even with the best effort it will be able to balance the pros and cons of every issue.\nReply Alert moderator\n\n",

    "document": "Republicans Move On Tax Overhaul In House And Senate Politics\nRepublicans Move On Tax Overhaul In House And Senate\nNovember 9, 2017 5:00 AM ETKelsey Snell\nTwitter\nEnlarge this image\nSeated behind a stack of IRS and tax volumes, Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.\nY.\n(left), and Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., attend a Ways and Means Committee debate on the GOP tax plan on Wednesday.\nJ. Scott Applewhite/APCongressional Republicans aim to take critical steps Thursday toward fulfilling their pledge to overhaul the nation's tax code by the end of the year.\nThe House Ways and Means Committee is expected to approve sweeping legislation to cut taxes for most individuals and businesses on the same day that Senate Republicans are set to unveil their own legislative vision for taxes.\nThe dueling proposals are part of a broader plan that GOP leaders hope will end with both chambers passing a compromise tax bill by the end of the year.\nCongressional leaders want to spend the remainder of the year focused on fulfilling President Trump's promise to sign tax cuts into law by Christmas.\nBut first the GOP will have to resolve lingering disagreements over which tax breaks should be eliminated to help pay for those cuts.\nMost Republicans say they must pass a tax bill this year to follow through on a key campaign promise to voters.\nIf they fail, many Republicans believe they will pay a serious political price during the midterm elections next year.\nBusiness\nHouse GOP Tax Plan Is Little Help To High-Tax States Like New Jersey\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Wednesday that he believes cutting taxes will \"bear fruit politically\" by helping families make ends meet.\n\"We've got to get on with keeping our promise,\" Ryan said at an event sponsored by the Washington Examiner.\n\"One of the chief promises we made when we ran for office ... was that we would do tax reform and tax cuts for families, for people, and so we've got to get on with that.\n\"The first step Thursday will be for the House Ways and Means Committee to wrap up debate on its legislation after four days of deliberations.\nThe committee aims to approve the bill by the end of the day, paving the way for a vote in the full House next week.\nThe House GOP plan would permanently slash the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent with a separate 25 percent rate for small businesses.\nThe plan would also take steps to make it harder for hedge funds and international corporations to avoid paying some U.\nS. taxes.\nOn the individual side, House Republicans plan to reduce the number of existing tax brackets from seven to four, while keeping a top tax rate of 39.6 percent for the highest earners.\nUnder the plan, taxpayers would see their standard deduction double to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, a change Republicans say would cut taxes for the majority of taxpayers.\nPolitics\nCHART: How The Tax Overhaul Would Affect You\nDemocrats say most of the benefits in the bill would go to big businesses and a handful of very wealthy people.\nThey point to a recent estimate from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that found roughly 56 percent of taxpayers earning over $1 million a year would see a tax break of over $500 by 2025.\nMore than half of those earning between $30,000 and $40,000 will see a tax break of under $100 that same year.\nThe committee worked this week to make some changes to the bill, including adjusting regulations on international businesses, that may drive up the overall cost of the legislation.\nFollowing those changes, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House plan would cost roughly $1.7 trillion over a decade, after factoring in payments on the new debt created by growing the deficit.\nThose projections illustrate one of the most difficult elements of these tax talks.\nRepublicans have been working around the clock behind the scenes to make sure their tax cuts don't create major losses for the federal government.\nDeficits will play an even bigger role in the tax debate in the Senate.\nRepublicans on the Senate Finance Committee are expected to unveil their proposals late in the day Thursday with plans to begin hearings on the bill early next week.\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told reporters earlier this week that he expects the bill will differ from the House legislation but did not say what changes would be included.\nUnlike the House, Senate tax writers are required to make sure their tax bill loses a maximum of $1.5 trillion over a decade.\nThat's because GOP leaders plan to take advantage of special Senate budget rules that allow some tax and spending legislation to pass with 51 votes instead of the 60 votes needed for most other legislation.\nThat would allow Republicans, who control 52 votes in the Senate, to pass the legislation without the help of a single Democrat.\nSenate leaders must carefully craft their bill to meet those strict deficit guidelines while still winning the votes of all but two of their members.\nIf they succeed, the House and Senate would go on to negotiate a compromise bill that would need a second approval in both chambers before becoming law.\nRepublicans have a long road ahead but House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said Wednesday he is confident the two chambers will reach an agreement.\n\"We're going to look to improve our bill at every step of the way,\" Brady said in an interview on NBC.\n\"We hope the Senate passes their best version of tax reform as well.\nWhat I'm confident of [is], we will reconcile and find common ground in the end.\"rep.\nkevin brady Senate Finance Committee Sen.

\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30d1\u30f3 Sandopan) is a Ground - type Pok\u00e9mon introduced in Generation I, and an Ice / Steel - type Pok\u00e9mon introduced in Generation VII which is only obtainable in the wild in Pok\u00e9mon Moon .\nContents [ show]Biology\nPhysiology\nSandslash is a tall, yellow, mammalian creature with brown spikes/quills on its back.\nIt has two very long claws on each \"hand\" used for digging and battling.\nSandslash can curl up to a small size just like its pre-evolved form Sandshrew, but it is of a much larger stature, which enhances its defense.\nAlolan Sandslash keeps the traits of its Alolan pre-evolution.\nIt is a tall, ice blue mammalian creature with steel-hard, ice blue crystals on its back.\nIt has two very long claws on each \"hand\" used for digging paths in the snow.\nThe weight of the ice makes it slower than regular Sandslash.\nEvolution\nSandslash evolves from Sandshrew at level 22, and Alolan Sandslash evolves from Alolan Sandshrew when an Ice Stone is used on it.\nGame info\nGame locations\nLocations\nVersion (s) Area (s) Rarity\nRed / Blue\nTrade  ( Red)Route 23, Cerulean Cave  ( Blue)None (Red) Uncommon (Blue)Yellow Cerulean Cave

Motivational salience\nMotivation as a desire to perform an action is usually defined as having two parts, directional such as directed towards a positive stimulus or away from a negative one, as well as the activated \"seeking phase\" and consummatory \"liking phase\".\nThis type of motivation has neurobiological roots in the basal ganglia, and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways.\nActivated \"seeking\" behavior, such as locomotor activity, is influenced by dopaminergic drugs, and microdialysis experiments reveal that dopamine is released during the anticipation of a reward.\n[1] The \"wanting behavior\" associated with a rewarding stimulus can be increased by microinjections of dopamine and dopaminergic drugs in the dorsorostral nucleus accumbens and posterior ventral palladum.\nOpioid injections in this area produce pleasure, however outside of these hedonic hotspots they create an increased desire.\n[2] Furthermore, depletion or inhibition of dopamine in neurons of the nucleus accumbens decreases appetitive but not consummatory behavior.\nDopamine is further implicated in motivation as administration of amphetamine increased the break point in a progressive ratio self-reinforcement schedule.\nThat is, subjects were willing to go to greater lengths (e.g.\npress a lever more times) to obtain a reward.\n[3]Psychological theories  [ edit]Motivation can be conceived of as a cycle in which thoughts influence behaviors, behaviors drive performance, performance affects thoughts, and the cycle begins again.\nEach stage of the cycle is composed of many dimensions including attitudes, beliefs, intentions, effort, and withdrawal which can all affect the motivation that an individual experiences.\nMost psychological theories hold that motivation exists purely within the individual, but socio-cultural theories express motivation as an outcome of participation in actions and activities within the cultural context of social groups.\n[4]Natural theories  [ edit]The natural system assumes that people have higher order needs, which contrasts with the rational theory that suggests people dislike work and only respond to rewards and punishment.\n[5] According to Mc\nGregor's Theory Y, human behavior is based on satisfying a hierarchy of needs: physiological, safety, social, ego, and self-fulfillment.\n[6]Physiological needs are the lowest and most important level.\nThese fundamental requirements include food, rest, shelter, and exercise.\nAfter physiological needs are satisfied, employees can focus on safety needs, which include \"protection against danger, threat, deprivation.\"  [6] However, if management makes arbitrary or biased employment decisions, then an employee's safety needs are unfulfilled.\nThe next set of needs is social, which refers to the desire for acceptance, affiliation, reciprocal friendships and love.\nAs such, the natural system of management assumes that close-knit work teams are productive.\nAccordingly, if an employee's social needs are unmet, then he will act disobediently.\n[6]There are two types of egoistic needs, the second-highest order of needs.\nThe first type refers to one's self-esteem, which encompasses self-confidence, independence, achievement, competence, and knowledge.\nThe second type of needs deals with reputation, status, recognition, and respect from colleagues.\n[6] Egoistic needs are much more difficult to satisfy.\nThe highest order of needs is for self-fulfillment, including recognition of one's full potential, areas for self-improvement, and the opportunity for creativity.\nThis differs from the rational system, which assumes that people prefer routine and security to creativity.\n[5] Unlike the rational management system, which assumes that humans don't care about these higher order needs, the natural system is based on these needs as a means for motivation.\nSelf-management through teamwork  [ edit]To successfully manage and motivate employees, the natural system posits that being part of a group is necessary.\n[7] Because of structural changes in social order, the workplace is more fluid and adaptive according to Mayo.\nAs a result, individual employees have lost their sense of stability and security, which can be provided by a membership in a group.\nHowever, if teams continuously change within jobs, then employees feel anxious, empty, and irrational and become harder to work with.\n[7] The innate desire for lasting human association and management \"is not related to single workers, but always to working groups.\"  [7] In groups, employees will self-manage and form relevant customs, duties, and traditions.\nWage incentives  [ edit]Humans are not motivated solely by wage incentives.\n[8] Unlike the rational theory of motivation, people are not driven toward economic interests under the natural system.\nFor instance, the straight piecework system pays employees based on each unit of their output.\nBased on studies such as the Bank Wiring Observation Room, using a piece rate incentive system does not lead to higher production.\n[8] Employees actually set upper limits on each person's daily output.\nThese actions stand \"in direct opposition to the ideas underlying their system of financial incentive, which countenanced no upper limit to performance other than physical capacity.\"  [8] Therefore, as opposed to the rational system that depends on economic rewards and punishments, the natural system of management assumes that humans are also motivated by non-economic factors.\nAutonomy  [ edit]Employees seek autonomy and responsibility in their work, contrary to assumptions of the rational theory of management.\nBecause supervisors have direct authority over employees, they must ensure that the employee's actions are in line with the standards of efficient conduct.\n[8] This creates a sense of restriction on the employee and these constraints are viewed as \"annoying and seemingly functioned only as subordinating or differentiating mechanisms.\"\n[8] Accordingly, the natural management system assumes that employees prefer autonomy and responsibility on the job and dislike arbitrary rules and overwhelming supervision.\nAn individual's motivation to complete a task is increased when this task is autonomous.\nWhen the motivation to complete a task comes from an \"external pressure\" that pressure then \"undermines\" a person's motivation, and as a result decreases a persons desire to complete the task.\n[9]Rational motivations  [ edit]The idea that human beings are rational and human behavior is guided by reason is an old one.\nHowever, recent research (on satisficing for example) has significantly undermined the idea of homo economicus or of perfect rationality in favour of a more bounded rationality.\nThe field of behavioural economics is particularly concerned with the limits of rationality in economic agents.\n[10]Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation  [ edit]Motivation can be divided into two different theories known as intrinsic  (internal or inherent) motivation and extrinsic  (external) motivation.\nIntrinsic motivation  [ edit]See also: Flow (psychology) and Ikigai\nIntrinsic motivation has been studied since the early 1970s.\nIntrinsic motivation is the self-desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to analyze one's capacity, to observe and to gain knowledge.\n[11] It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on external pressures or a desire for consideration.\nThe phenomenon of intrinsic motivation was first acknowledged within experimental studies of animal behavior.\nIn these studies, it was evident that the organisms would engage in playful and curiosity-driven behaviors in the absence of reward.\nIntrinsic motivation is a natural motivational tendency and is a critical element in cognitive, social, and physical development.\n[12] The two necessary elements for intrinsic motivation are self-determination and an increase in perceived competence.\n[13] In short, the cause of the behavior must be internal, known as internal local of causality, and the individual who engages in the behavior must perceive that the task increases their competence.\n[12]Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to engage in the task willingly as well as work to improve their skills, which will increase their capabilities.\n[14] Students are likely to be intrinsically motivated if they:attribute their educational results to factors under their own control, also known as autonomy or locus of controlbelieve they have the skills to be effective agents in reaching their desired goals, also known as self-efficacy beliefsare interested in mastering a topic, not just in achieving good grades\nAn example of intrinsic motivation is when an employee becomes an IT professional because he or she wants to learn about how computer users interact with computer networks.\nThe employee has the intrinsic motivation to gain more knowledge.\n[15]Art for art's sake is an example of intrinsic motivation in the domain of art.\nTraditionally, researchers thought of motivations to use computer systems to be primarily driven by extrinsic purposes; however, many modern systems have their use driven primarily by intrinsic motivations.\n[16] Examples of such systems used primarily to fulfil users' intrinsic motivations, include on-line gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping  [17], learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and general gamification.\nEven traditional management information systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) are being 'gamified' such that both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations must increasingly be considered.\nNot only can intrinsic motivation be used in a personal setting, but it can also be implemented and utilized in a social environment.\nInstead of attaining mature desires, such as those presented above via internet which can be attained on one's own, intrinsic motivation can be used to assist extrinsic motivation to attain a goal.\nFor example, Eli, a 4-year-old with autism, wants to achieve the goal of playing with a toy train  [18].\nTo get the toy, he must first communicate to his therapist that he wants it.\nHis desire to play is strong enough to be considered intrinsic motivation because it is a natural feeling, and his desire to communicate with his therapist to get the train can be considered extrinsic motivation because the outside object is a reward (see incentive theory).\nCommunicating with the therapist is the first, slightly more challenging goal that stands in the way of achieving his larger goal of playing with the train.\nAchieving these goals in attainable pieces is also known as the goal-setting theory.\nAdvantages: Intrinsic motivation can be long-lasting and self-sustaining.\nEfforts to build this kind of motivation are also typically efforts at promoting student learning.\nSuch efforts often focus on the subject rather than rewards or punishments.\nDisadvantages: Efforts at fostering intrinsic motivation can be slow to affect behavior and can require special and lengthy preparation.\nStudents are individuals, so a variety of approaches may be needed to motivate different students.\nIt is often helpful to know what interests one's students in order to connect these interests with the subject matter.\nThis requires getting to know one's students.\nAlso, it helps if the instructor is interested in the subject.\n[19]Extrinsic motivation  [ edit]See also: Goal orientation\nExtrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual.\nIn extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence.\nUsually extrinsic motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation.\n[20] Common extrinsic motivations are rewards  (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior.\nCompetition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity.\nA cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.\n[21]The most simple distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is the type of reasons or goals that lead to an action.\nWhile intrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable, extrinsic motivation, refers to doing something because it leads to a separable outcome.\nExtrinsic motivation thus contrasts with intrinsic motivation, which is doing an activity simply for the enjoyment of the activity itself, instead of for its instrumental value.\n[22]Social psychological research has indicated that extrinsic rewards can lead to overjustification and a subsequent reduction in intrinsic motivation.\nIn one study demonstrating this effect, children who expected to be (and were) rewarded with a ribbon and a gold star for drawing pictures spent less time playing with the drawing materials in subsequent observations than children who were assigned to an unexpected reward condition.\n[23] However, another study showed that third graders who were rewarded with a book showed more reading behavior in the future, implying that some rewards do not undermine intrinsic motivation.\n[24] While the provision of extrinsic rewards might reduce the desirability of an activity, the use of extrinsic constraints, such as the threat of punishment, against performing an activity has actually been found to increase one's intrinsic interest in that activity.\nIn one study, when children were given mild threats against playing with an attractive toy, it was found that the threat actually served to increase the child's interest in the toy, which was previously undesirable to the child in the absence of threat.\n[25]Behaviorist theories  [ edit]While many theories on motivation have a mentalistic perspective, behaviorists focus only on observable behavior and theories founded on experimental evidence.\nIn the view of behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about what factors cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motives would be ignored.\nWhere others would speculate about such things as values, drives, or needs, that may not be observed directly, behaviorists are interested in the observable variables that affect the type, intensity, frequency and duration of observable behavior.\nThrough the basic research of such scientists as Pavlov, Watson and Skinner, several basic mechanisms that govern behavior have been identified.\nThe most important of these are classical conditioning and operant conditioning.\nClassical and operant conditioning  [ edit]Main article: Motivational salience\nIn classical (or respondent) conditioning, behavior is understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli.\nThey can be unconditioned, such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus.\nIn relation to motivation, classical conditioning might be seen as one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations.\n[26]  [27] For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.\nIn operant conditioning, the type and frequency of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences.\nIf a certain behavior, in the presence of a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a reinforcer ), the emitted behavior will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one).\nConversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a punisher ), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus.\nIn a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment).\n[26]  [27] For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future ( positive reinforcement ); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she might seem less motivated to do school work in the future ( negative punishment ).\nIf a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention ( positive punishment ), that behavior would decrease in the future.\nThe student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention ( negative reinforcement ).\nThe strength of reinforcement or punishment is dependent on schedule and timing.\nA reinforcer or punisher affects the future frequency of a behavior most strongly if it occurs within seconds of the behavior.\nA behavior that is reinforced intermittently, at unpredictable intervals, will be more robust and persistent, compared to one that is reinforced every time the behavior is performed.\n[26]  [27] For example, if the misbehaving student in the above example was punished a week after the troublesome behavior, that might not affect future behavior.\nIn addition to these basic principles, environmental stimuli also affect behavior.\nBehavior is punished or reinforced in the context of whatever stimuli were present just before the behavior was performed, which means that a particular behavior might not be affected in every environmental context, or situation, after it is punished or reinforced in one specific context.\n[26]  [27] A lack of praise for school-related behavior might, for instance, not decrease after-school sports-related behavior that is usually reinforced by praise.\nThe various mechanisms of operant conditioning may be used to understand the motivation for various behaviors by examining what happens just after the behavior (the consequence), in what context the behavior is performed or not performed (the antecedent), and under what circumstances (motivating operators).\n[26]  [27]Incentive motivation  [ edit]Main section: Motivational salience \u00a7 Incentive salience\nIncentive theory is a specific theory of motivation, derived partly from behaviorist principles of reinforcement, which concerns an incentive or motive to do something.\nThe most common incentive would be a compensation.\nCompensation can be tangible or intangible, It helps in motivating the employees in their corporate life, students in academics and inspire to do more and more to achieve profitability in every field.\nStudies show that if the person receives the reward immediately, the effect is greater, and decreases as delay lengthens.\n[28] Repetitive action-reward combination can cause the action to become a habit.\n[28]\"Reinforcers and reinforcement principles of behavior differ from the hypothetical construct of reward.\"\nA reinforcer is anything that follows an action, with the intentions that the action will now occur more frequently.\nFrom this perspective, the concept of distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic forces is irrelevant.\nIncentive theory in psychology treats motivation and behavior of the individual as they are influenced by beliefs, such as engaging in activities that are expected to be profitable.\nIncentive theory is promoted by behavioral psychologists, such as B.\nF. Skinner.\nIncentive theory is especially supported by Skinner in his philosophy of Radical behaviorism, meaning that a person's actions always have social ramifications: and if actions are positively received people are more likely to act in this manner, or if negatively received people are less likely to act in this manner.\nIncentive theory distinguishes itself from other motivation theories, such as drive theory, in the direction of the motivation.\nIn incentive theory, stimuli \"attract\" a person towards them, and push them towards the stimulus.\nIn terms of behaviorism, incentive theory involves positive reinforcement: the reinforcing stimulus has been conditioned to make the person happier.\nAs opposed to in drive theory, which involves negative reinforcement: a stimulus has been associated with the removal of the punishment\u2014the lack of homeostasis in the body.\nFor example, a person has come to know that if they eat when hungry, it will eliminate that negative feeling of hunger, or if they drink when thirsty, it will eliminate that negative feeling of thirst.\n[28]Motivating operations  [ edit]Motivating operations, MOs, relate to the field of motivation in that they help improve understanding aspects of behavior that are not covered by operant conditioning.\nIn operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence future behavior.\nThe presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism \u2013 only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do.\nThrough the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.\nMotivating operations are factors that affect learned behavior in a certain context.\nMOs have two effects: a value-altering effect, which increases or decreases the efficiency of a reinforcer, and a behavior-altering effect, which modifies learned behavior that has previously been punished or reinforced by a particular stimulus.\n[26]When a motivating operation causes an increase in the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or amplifies a learned behavior in some way (such as increasing frequency, intensity, duration or speed of the behavior), it functions as an establishing operation, EO.\nA common example of this would be food deprivation, which functions as an EO in relation to food: the food-deprived organism will perform behaviors previously related to the acquisition of food more intensely, frequently, longer, or faster in the presence of food, and those behaviors would be especially strongly reinforced.\n[26] For instance, a fast-food worker earning minimal wage, forced to work more than one job to make ends meet, would be highly motivated by a pay raise, because of the current deprivation of money (a conditioned establishing operation).\nThe worker would work hard to try to achieve the raise, and getting the raise would function as an especially strong reinforcer of work behavior.\nConversely, a motivating operation that causes a decrease in the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or diminishes a learned behavior related to the reinforcer, functions as an abolishing operation, AO.\nAgain using the example of food, satiation of food prior to the presentation of a food stimulus would produce a decrease on food-related behaviors, and diminish or completely abolish the reinforcing effect of acquiring and ingesting the food.\n[26] Consider the board of a large investment bank, concerned with a too small profit margin, deciding to give the CEO a new incentive package in order to motivate him to increase firm profits.\nIf the CEO already has a lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on money.\nGetting even more money wouldn't be a strong reinforcer for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn't elicit increased intensity, frequency or duration of profit-increasing behavior.\nMotivation and psychotherapy  [ edit]See also: Motivational interviewing\nMotivation lies at the core of many behaviorist approaches to psychological treatment.\nA person with autism-spectrum disorder is seen as lacking motivation to perform socially relevant behaviors \u2013 social stimuli are not as reinforcing for people with autism compared to other people.\nDepression is understood as a lack of reinforcement (especially positive reinforcement) leading to extinction of behavior in the depressed individual.\nA patient with specific phobia is not motivated to seek out the phobic stimulus because it acts as a punisher, and is over-motivated to avoid it (negative reinforcement).\nIn accordance, therapies have been designed to address these problems, such as EIBI and CBT for major depression and specific phobia.\nSocio-cultural theory  [ edit]Sociocultural theory (see Cultural-historical psychology) (also known as Social Motivation) emphasizes impact of activity and actions mediated through social interaction, and within social contexts.\nSociocultural theory represents a shift from traditional theories of motivation, which view the individual's innate drives or mechanistic operand learning as primary determinants of motivation.\nCritical elements to socio-cultural theory applied to motivation include, but are not limited to, the role of social interactions and the contributions from culturally-based knowledge and practice.\n[4] Sociocultural theory extends the social aspects of Cognitive Evaluation Theory, which espouses the important role of positive feedback from others during action,  [11] but requires the individual as the internal locus of causality.\nSociocultural theory predicts that motivation has an external locus of causality, and is socially distributed among the social group.\n[4]An example of socio cultural theory would be social settings where people work together to solve collective problems, such as athletic teams, study groups, work groups, and civic organization.\n[29] Although individuals will have internalized goals, they will also develop internalized goals of others, as well as new interests and goals collectively with those that they feel socially connected to.\n[29]Social motivation is tied to one's activity in a group.\nIt cannot form from a single mind alone.\nFor example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are much less likely to smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction does not need to be communicated, and so it is internalized.\nHowever, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork.\n[29] Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship.\nIt is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives.\n[29] Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.\nPush and pull  [ edit]Push motivations are those where people push themselves towards their goals or to achieve something, such as the desire for escape, rest and relaxation, prestige, health and fitness, adventure, and social interaction.\n[30]However, with push motivation it's also easy to get discouraged when there are obstacles present in the path of achievement.\nPush motivation acts as a willpower and people's willpower is only as strong as the desire behind the willpower.\n[31]Additionally, a study has been conducted on social networking and its push and pull effects.\nOne thing that is mentioned is \"Regret and dissatisfaction correspond to push factors because regret and dissatisfaction are the negative factors that compel users to leave their current service provider.\"\n[32] So from reading this, we now know that Push motivations can also be a negative force.\nIn this case, that negative force is regret and dissatisfaction.\nPull motivation is the opposite of push.\nIt is a type of motivation that is much stronger.\n\"Some of the factors are those that emerge as a result of the attractiveness of a destination as it is perceived by those with the propensity to travel.\nThey include both tangible resources, such as beaches, recreation facilities, and cultural attractions, and traveler's perceptions and expectation, such as novelty, benefit expectation, and marketing image.\"\n[30] Pull motivation can be seen as the desire to achieve a goal so badly that it seems that the goal is pulling us toward it.\nThat is why pull motivation is stronger than push motivation.\nIt is easier to be drawn to something rather than to push yourself for something you desire.\nIt can also be an alternative force when compared to negative force.\nFrom the same study as previously mentioned, \"Regret and dissatisfaction with an existing SNS service provider may trigger a heightened interest toward switching service providers, but such a motive will likely translate into reality in the presence of a good alternative.\nTherefore, alternative attractiveness can moderate the effects of regret and dissatisfaction with switching intention\"  [32] And so, pull motivation can be an attracting desire when negative influences come into the picture.\nSelf-control  [ edit]Main articles: Self-control and Inhibitory control\nThe self-control aspect of motivation is increasingly considered to be a subset of emotional intelligence;  [33] it is suggested that although a person may be classed as highly intelligent (as measured by many traditional intelligence tests ), they may remain unmotivated to pursue intellectual endeavours.\nVroom's \" expectancy theory \" provides an account of when people may decide to exert self-control in pursuit of a particular goal.\nDrives  [ edit]Main article: Drive theory\nA drive or desire can be described as a deficiency or need that activates behavior that is aimed at a goal or an incentive.\n[34] These drives are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior.\nBasic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner pleasing to others.\nAnother basic drive is the sexual drive which like food motivates us because it is essential to our survival.\n[35] The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire.\n[35] The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called Dehydroepiandrosterone  (DHEA).\n[35] The hormonal basis of both men and women's sex drives is testosterone.\n[35] Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than women to think about sex.\n[35]Drive-reduction theory  [ edit]Clark Hull was the behaviorist who developed the drive-reduction theory of motivation.\nDrive theory grows out of the concept that people have certain biological drives, such as hunger and thirst.\nAs time passes the strength of the drive increases if it is not satisfied (in this case by eating).\nUpon satisfying a drive the drive's strength is reduced.\nCreated by Clark Hull and further developed by Kenneth Spence, the theory became well known in the 1940s and 1950s.\nMany of the motivational theories that arose during the 1950s and 1960s were either based on Hull's original theory or were focused on providing alternatives to the drive-reduction theory, including Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which emerged as an alternative to Hull's approach.\n[36]Drive theory has some intuitive or folk validity.\nFor instance when preparing food, the drive model appears to be compatible with sensations of rising hunger as the food is prepared, and, after the food has been consumed, a decrease in subjective hunger.\n[37] There are several problems, however, that leave the validity of drive reduction open for debate.\nCognitive dissonance theory  [ edit]Main article: Cognitive dissonance\nSuggested by Leon Festinger, cognitive dissonance occurs when an individual experiences some degree of discomfort resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: their views on the world around them, and their own personal feelings and actions.\n[28] For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable.\nTheir feeling that another purchase would have been preferable is inconsistent with their action of purchasing the item.\nThe difference between their feelings and beliefs causes dissonance, so they seek to reassure themselves.\nWhile not a theory of motivation, per se, the theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance.\nThe cognitive miser perspective makes people want to justify things in a simple way in order to reduce the effort they put into cognition.\nThey do this by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or actions, rather than facing the inconsistencies, because dissonance is a mental strain.\nDissonance is also reduced by justifying, blaming, and denying.\nIt is one of the most influential and extensively studied theories in social psychology.\nContent theories  [ edit]The content theory was one of the earliest theories of motivation.\nContent theories can also be referred to needs theories, because the theory focuses on the importance of what motivates people (needs).\nIn other words, they try to identify what are the \"needs\" and how they relate to motivation to fulfill those needs.\nAnother definition could be defined by Pritchard and Ashwood, is the process used to allocate energy to maximize the satisfaction of needs.\n[38]Maslow's hierarchy of needs  [ edit]Maslow's Pyramid\nContent theory of human motivation includes both Abraham Maslow 's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg 's two-factor theory.\nMaslow's theory is one of the most widely discussed theories of motivation.\nAbraham Maslow believed that man is inherently good and argued that individuals possess a constantly growing inner drive that has great potential.\nThe needs hierarchy system, devised by Maslow (1954), is a commonly used scheme for classifying human motives.\n[39]The American motivation psychologist Abraham H. Maslow developed the hierarchy of needs consisting of five hierarchic classes.\nAccording to Maslow, people are motivated by unsatisfied needs.\nThe needs, listed from basic (lowest-earliest) to most complex (highest-latest) are as follows:  [40]Physiology  ( hunger, thirst, sleep, etc.\n)Safety / Security / Shelter / Health\nSocial / Love / Friendship\nSelf-esteem / Recognition /Achievement\nSelf actualization /achievement of full potential\nThe basic requirements build upon the first step in the pyramid: physiology.\nIf there are deficits on this level, all behavior will be oriented to satisfy this deficit.\nEssentially, if you have not slept or eaten adequately, you won't be interested in your self-esteem desires.\nSubsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security.\nAfter securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level.\nPsychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and self-actualization.\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs theory can be summarized as follows:\nHuman beings have wants and desires which influence their behavior.\nOnly unsatisfied needs influence behavior, satisfied needs do not.\nNeeds are arranged in order of importance to human life, from the basic to the complex.\nThe person advances to the next level of needs only after the lower level need is at least minimally satisfied.\nThe further the progress up the hierarchy, the more individuality, humanness and psychological health a person will show.\nHerzberg's two-factor theory  [ edit]Main article: Two-factor theory\nTwo-factor theory\nFrederick Herzberg 's two-factor theory concludes that certain factors in the workplace result in job satisfaction, but if absent, they don't lead to dissatisfaction but no satisfaction.\nThe factors that motivate people can change over their lifetime, but \"respect for me as a person\" is one of the top motivating factors at any stage of life.\nHe distinguished between:\nMotivators  (e.g.\nchallenging work, recognition, responsibility) which give positive satisfaction, and\nHygiene factors  (e.g.\nstatus, job security, salary and fringe benefits) that do not motivate if present, but, if absent, result in demotivation.\nHerzberg concluded that job satisfaction and dissatisfaction were the products of two separate factors: motivating factors (satisfiers) and hygiene factors (dissatisfiers).\nSome motivating factors (satisfiers) were: Achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, advancement, and growth.\nSome hygiene factors (dissatisfiers) were: company policy, supervision, working conditions, interpersonal relations, salary, status, job security, and personal life.\n[41]The name hygiene factors is used because, like hygiene, the presence will not improve health, but absence can cause health deterioration.\nHerzberg's theory has found application in such occupational fields as information systems and in studies of user satisfaction such as computer user satisfaction.\nAlderfer's ERG theory  [ edit]Main article: ERG theory\nAlderfer, expanding on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, created the ERG theory.\nThis theory posits that there are three groups of core needs \u2014 existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory.\nThe existence group is concerned with providing our basic material existence requirements.\nThey include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs.\nThe second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships.\nThese social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification.\nFinally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development.\nMaslow's categories are broken down into many different parts and there are a lot of needs.\nThe ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas.\nAs a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow.\nAll these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being.\n[42] These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.\nSelf-determination theory  [ edit]Main article: Self-determination theory\nSince the early 1970s Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan  [43] have conducted research that eventually led to the proposition of the self-determination theory (SDT).\nThis theory focuses on the degree to which an individual's behaviour is self-motivated and self-determined.\nSDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth: competence,  [44]  [45] relatedness,  [46] and autonomy.\n[47]  [48]These three psychological needs motivate the self to initiate specific behaviour and mental nutriments that are essential for psychological health and well-being.\nWhen these needs are satisfied, there are positive consequences, such as well-being and growth, leading people to be motivated, productive and happy.\nWhen they are thwarted, people's motivation, productivity and happiness plummet.\n[49]There are three essential elements to the theory:  [50]Humans are inherently proactive with their potential and mastering their inner forces (such as drive and emotions).\nHumans have an inherent tendency towards growth, development and integrated functioning.\nOptimal development and actions are inherent in humans but they do not happen automatically.\nTemporal motivation theory  [ edit]Main article: Temporal motivation theory\nA recent approach in developing a broad, integrative theory of motivation is temporal motivation theory.\n[51] Introduced in a 2006 Academy of Management Review article,  [52] it synthesizes into a single formulation the primary aspects of several other major motivational theories, including Incentive Theory, Drive Theory, Need Theory, Self-Efficacy and Goal Setting.\nIt simplifies the field of motivation and allows findings from one theory to be translated into terms of another.\nAnother journal article that helped to develop the Temporal Motivation Theory, \"The Nature of Procrastination,  [53] \" received American Psychological Association's George A. Miller award for outstanding contribution to general science.where Motivation is the desire for a particular outcome, Expectancy or self-efficacy is the probability of success, Value is the reward associated with the outcome, Impulsiveness is the individual's sensitivity to delay and Delay is the time to realization.\n[53]Achievement motivation  [ edit]Achievement motivation is an integrative perspective based on the premise that performance motivation results from the way broad components of personality are directed towards performance.\nAs a result, it includes a range of dimensions that are relevant to success at work but which are not conventionally regarded as being part of performance motivation.\nThe emphasis on performance seeks to integrate formerly separate approaches as need for achievement  [54] with, for example, social motives like dominance.\nPersonality is intimately tied to performance and achievement motivation, including such characteristics as tolerance for risk, fear of failure, and others.\n[55]  [56]  [57]Achievement motivation can be measured by The Achievement Motivation Inventory, which is based on this theory and assesses three factors (in 17 separated scales) relevant to vocational and professional success.\nThis motivation has repeatedly been linked with adaptive motivational patterns, including working hard, a willingness to pick learning tasks with much difficulty, and attributing success to effort.\n[58]Achievement motivation was studied intensively by David C. Mc\nClelland, John W. Atkinson and their colleagues since the early 1950s.\n[59] This type of motivation is a drive that is developed from an emotional state.\nOne may feel the drive to achieve by striving for success and avoiding failure.\nIn achievement motivation, one would hope that they excel in what they do and not think much about the failures or the negatives.\n[60] Their research showed that business managers who were successful demonstrated a high need to achieve no matter the culture.\nThere are three major characteristics of people who have a great need to achieve according to Mc\nClelland's research.\nThey would prefer a work environment in which they are able to assume responsibility for solving problems.\nThey would take calculated risk and establish moderate, attainable goals.\nThey want to hear continuous recognition, as well as feedback, in order for them to know how well they are doing.\n[61]Cognitive theories  [ edit]Cognitive theories define motivation in terms of how people think about situations.\nCognitive theories of motivation include goal-setting theory and expectancy theory.\nGoal-setting theory  [ edit]Main article: Goal-setting theory\nGoal-setting theory is based on the notion that individuals sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state.\nOften, this end state is a reward in itself.\nA goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity.\nOne common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\nTime management is an important aspect to consider, when regarding time as a factor contributing to goal achievement.\nHaving too much time allows area for distraction and procrastination, which simultaneously distracts the subject by steering his or her attention away from the original goal.\nAn ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close.\n[62] With an overly restricting time restraint, the subject could potentially feel overwhelmed, which could deter the subject from achieving the goal because the amount of time provided is not sufficient or rational.\n[63] This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra.\nA goal should be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete.\n[63]Most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success).\nAt the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed.\nSpecificity concerns the description of the goal in their class.\nThe goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual.\n[62] Similarly to Maslow 's Hierarchy of Needs, a larger end goal is easier to achieve if the subject has smaller, more attainable yet still challenging goals to achieve first in order to advance over a period of time.\n[63] A classic example of a poorly specified goal is trying to motivate oneself to run a marathon when s/he has not had proper training.\nA smaller, more attainable goal is to first motivate oneself to take the stairs instead of an elevator or to replace a stagnant activity, like watching television, with a mobile one, like spending time walking and eventually working up to a jog.\nNote: all goals are subject to the individual's skills and abilities.\nExpectancy theory  [ edit]Main article: Expectancy theory\nExpectancy theory was proposed by Victor H. Vroom in 1964.\nExpectancy theory explains the behavior process in which an individual selects a behavior option over another, and why/how this decision is made in relation to their goal.\nThere's also an equation for this theory which goes as follows:or [64]M (Motivation) is the amount an individual will be motivated by the condition or environment they placed themselves in.\nWhich is based from the following hence the equation.\nE (Expectancy) is the person's perception that effort will result in performance.\nIn other words, it's the person assessment of how well and what kind of effort will relate in better performance.\nI (Instrumentality) is the person's perception that performance will be rewarded or punished.\nV (Valence) is the perceived amount of the reward or punishment that will result from the performance.\"\n[64]Models of behavior change  [ edit]See also: Cognitive control\nSocial-cognitive models of behavior change include the constructs of motivation and volition.\nMotivation is seen as a process that leads to the forming of behavioral intentions.\nVolition is seen as a process that leads from intention to actual behavior.\nIn other words, motivation and volition refer to goal setting and goal pursuit, respectively.\nBoth processes require self-regulatory efforts.\nSeveral self-regulatory constructs are needed to operate in orchestration to attain goals.\nAn example of such a motivational and volitional construct is perceived self-efficacy.\nSelf-efficacy is supposed to facilitate the forming of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans, and the initiation of action.\nIt can support the translation of intentions into action.\nJohn W. Atkinson, David Birch and their colleagues developed the theory of \"Dynamics of Action\" to mathematically model change in behavior as a consequence of the interaction of motivation and associated tendencies toward specific actions.\n[65]  [66] The theory posits that change in behavior occurs when the tendency for a new, unexpressed behavior becomes dominant over the tendency currently motivating action.\nIn the theory, the strength of tendencies rises and falls as a consequence of internal and external stimuli (sources of instigation), inhibitory factors, and consummatory in factors such as performing an action.\nIn this theory, there are three causes responsible for behavior and change in behavior:\nInstigation (Ts) \u2013 increases tendency when an activity has intrinsic ability to satisfy;Inhibition (Taf) \u2013 decreases tendency when there are obstacles to performing an activity; and\nConsummation \u2013 decreases a tendency as it is performed.\n[67]  [68]Thematic apperception test  [ edit]Main article: Thematic apperception test\nPsychologists David C. Mc\nClelland and John W. Atkinson argued that motivation should be unconscious.\nThey refined measures of motivation by means of content analysis of imaginative thought using, for example, the Thematic Apperception Test.'\n[69]  [70]Intrinsic motivation and the 16 basic desires theory  [ edit]Starting from studies involving more than 6,000 people, Professor Steven Reiss has proposed a theory that found 16 basic desires that guide nearly all human behavior.\n[71]  [72] Intrinsic motivation is the tendency to find challenges, to push to find out for more, explore, and learn as much as possible.\nIt is about reaching the most possible potential as a human being.\n[20] The 16 basic desires that motivate our actions and define our personalities are:\nAcceptance, the need for approval\nCuriosity, the need to learn\nEating, the need for food\nFamily, the need to raise children\nHonor, the need to be loyal to the traditional values of one's clan/ethnic group\nIdealism, the need for social justice\nIndependence, the need for individuality\nOrder, the need for organized, stable, predictable environments\nPhysical activity, the need for exercise\nPower, the need for influence of will\nRomance, the need for sex and for beauty\nSaving, the need to collect\nSocial contact, the need for friends (peer relationships)Social status, the need for social standing/importance\nTranquility, the need to be safe\nVengeance, the need to strike back and to compete\nAttribution theory  [ edit]Main article: Attribution (psychology)Attribution theory is a theory developed by psychologist, Fritz Heider that describes the processes by which individuals explain the causes of their behavior and events.\n[73] A form of attribution theory developed by psychologist, Bernard Weiner describes an individual's beliefs about how the causes of success or failure affect their emotions and motivations.\nBernard Weiner's theory can be defined into two perspectives: intrapersonal or interpersonal.\nThe intrapersonal perspective includes self-directed thoughts and emotions that are attributed to the self.\nThe interpersonal perspective includes beliefs about the responsibility of others and other directed affects of emotions; the individual would place the blame on another individual.\n[74]Individuals formulate explanatory attributions to understand the events they experience and to seek reasons for their failures.\nWhen individuals seek positive feedback from their failures, they use the feedback as motivation to show improved performances.\nFor example, using the intrapersonal perspective, a student who failed a test may attribute their failure for not studying enough and would use their emotion of shame or embarrassment as motivation to study harder for the next test.\nA student who blames their test failure on the teacher would be using the interpersonal perspective, and would use their feeling of disappointment as motivation to rely on a different study source other than the teacher for the next test.\nApproach versus avoidance  [ edit]Main article: Motivational salience\nApproach motivation (i.e., incentive salience) can be defined as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is rewarded or results in a positive or desirable outcome.\nIn contrast, avoidance motivation (i.e., aversive salience) can be defined as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is punished or results in a negative or undesirable outcome.\n[69]  [75] Research suggests that, all else being equal, avoidance motivations tend to be more powerful than approach motivations.\nBecause people expect losses to have more powerful emotional consequences than equal-size gains, they will take more risks to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.\n[69]Practical applications  [ edit]The control of motivation is only understood to a limited extent.\nThere are many different approaches of motivation training, but many of these are considered pseudoscientific by critics.\nTo understand how to control motivation it is first necessary to understand why many people lack motivation.\nImplementations of Natural theories  [ edit]Natural theories of motivation such as Theory Y argue that individuals are naturally willing to work and prefer jobs with high responsibility, creativity and ingenuity.\n[5] Holistically, the implementation in the workplace based on natural theories of motivation requires creating a comfortable and open work environment because it is through this climate that the individuals' goals are most likely to be aligned with the organization's goals.\nBased on the assumptions of natural theorists, individuals are motivated to work for an organization when they feel fulfillment from the work and organization.\nTherefore, hiring should focus on matching the goals of the individual with the goals of the organization rather than solely on the candidate's proficiency at completing a task, as rational theorists would argue.\nLogistically, there are several ways that firms can implement the assumptions of natural theories of motivation, including delegation of responsibilities, participation in management by employees, job enlargement, and membership within the firm.\nDelegation of responsibilities  [ edit]Mc\nGregor's Theory Y makes the assumption that the average person not only accepts, but also seeks out responsibility.\n[6] Thus, as a firm gives individuals' greater responsibilities, they will feel a greater sense of satisfaction and, subsequently, more commitment to the organization.\nAdditionally, Malone argues that the delegation of responsibility encourages motivation because employees have creative control over their work and increases productivity as many people can work collaboratively to solve a problem rather than just one manager tackling it alone.\n[76]Participative management  [ edit]Participative management styles involve consulting employees through the decision making process.\nMarkowitz argues that this boosts employees' morale and commitment to the organization, subsequently increasing productivity.\n[77] Furthermore, Denison provides empirical evidence demonstrating that employee participation is correlated with better organizational performance.\n[78] It is important to note that this stands in contract to Graham's rationalist view that kaizen, a participative management style used in Japan, does not engage employees' minds in the decision making process.\n[79] Graham, however, only examines one specific and flawed participative management style that only allows limited input from employees.\n[79] With a properly implemented process that actively engages employees, participative management will create a welcoming and productive environment.\nJob enlargement  [ edit]Job enlargement refers to increasing the responsibilities of a job by adding to the scope of the tasks.\nThis provides more variety and prevents a job from getting boring.\nAdditionally, this prevents the problem of alienation brought on by the rational theorists of Fordism.\n[5] In assembly lines, the employee feels disconnected from the final product because he or she only performs one task repeatedly.\nJob enlargement instead keeps employees engaged in the organization and creates a more welcoming environment.\nIt stems on the assumption that employees enjoy doing work and, therefore, are more satisfied when they have a wider range of work to do.\nFirm membership  [ edit]As Mayo details, based on observations of the Hawthorn Western Electric Company, an additional facet of motivation stems from creating a culture of teams and membership within the firm.\n[7] For employees, a large part of job satisfaction is feeling as though one is a member of a larger team.\nFor example, Mayo writes about a young girl worker who refused a transfer to a higher paid position in order to stay with a group that she felt a connection to.\n[7] This example demonstrates that workers are not necessarily rational and only working for higher monetary compensation; instead, the social aspects of a firm can provide incentives to work.\nIt is important, therefore, to create an inclusive environment that welcomes each worker or employee as a member of that organization.\nEmployee motivation  [ edit]Main article: Employee motivation\nJob characteristics model  [ edit]Main article: Job characteristics model\nThe job characteristics Model (JCM), as designed by Hackman  [80] and Oldham attempts to use job design to improve employee motivation.\nThey show that any job can be described in terms of five key job characteristics:  [81]  [82]Skill variety \u2013 the degree to which the job requires the use of different skills and talents\nTask identity \u2013 the degree to which the job has contributed to a clearly identifiable larger project\nTask significance \u2013 the degree to which the job affects the lives or work of other people\nAutonomy \u2013 the degree to which the worker has independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job\nTask feedback \u2013 the degree to which the worker is provided with clear, specific, detailed, actionable information about the effectiveness of his or her job performance\nThe JCM links the core job dimensions listed above to critical psychological states which results in desired personal and work outcomes.\nThis forms the basis of this 'employee growth-need strength.\"\nThe core dimensions listed above can be combined into a single predictive index, called the motivating potential score.\nMotivating potential score  [ edit]See also: Work motivation and Job satisfaction\nThe motivating potential score  (MPS) can be calculated, using the core dimensions discussed above, as follows:\nSkill Variety+Task Identity+Task Significance\nJobs high in motivating potential must be high on both Autonomy and Feedback, and also must be high on at least one of the three factors that lead to experienced meaningfulness.\n[83] If a job has a high MPS, the job characteristics model predicts motivation, performance and job satisfaction will be positively affected and the likelihood of negative outcomes, such as absenteeism and turnover, will be reduced.\n[83]Employee recognition programs  [ edit]Employee recognition is not only about gifts and points.\nIt's about changing the corporate culture in order to meet goals and initiatives and most importantly to connect employees to the company's core values and beliefs.\nStrategic employee recognition is seen as the most important program not only to improve employee retention and motivation but also to positively influence the financial situation.\n[84] The difference between the traditional approach (gifts and points) and strategic recognition is the ability to serve as a serious business influencer that can advance a company's strategic objectives in a measurable way.\n\"The vast majority of companies want to be innovative, coming up with new products, business models and better ways of doing things.\nHowever, innovation is not so easy to achieve.\nA CEO cannot just order it, and so it will be.\nYou have to carefully manage an organization so that, over time, innovations will emerge.\"\n[85]Education  [ edit]Motivation is of particular interest to educational psychologists because of the crucial role it plays in student learning.\nHowever, the specific kind of motivation that is studied in the specialized setting of education differs qualitatively from the more general forms of motivation studied by psychologists in other fields.\nMotivation in education can have several effects on how students learn and how they behave towards subject matter.\n[86] It can:\nDirect behavior toward particular goals\nLead to increased effort and energy\nIncrease initiation of, and persistence in, activities\nEnhance cognitive processing\nDetermine what consequences are reinforcing\nLead to improved performance.\nBecause students are not always internally motivated, they sometimes need situated motivation, which is found in environmental conditions that the teacher creates.\nIf teachers decided to extrinsically reward productive student behaviors, they may find it difficult to extricate themselves from that path.\nConsequently, student dependency on extrinsic rewards represents one of the greatest detractors from their use in the classroom.\n[87]The majority of new student orientation leaders at colleges and universities recognize that distinctive needs of students should be considered in regard to orientation information provided at the beginning of the higher education experience.\nResearch done by Whyte in 1986 raised the awareness of counselors and educators in this regard.\nIn 2007, the National Orientation Directors Association reprinted Cassandra B. Whyte 's research report allowing readers to ascertain improvements made in addressing specific needs of students over a quarter of a century later to help with academic success.\n[88]Generally, motivation is conceptualized as either intrinsic or extrinsic.\nClassically, these categories are regarded as distinct.\n[89] Today, these concepts are less likely to be used as distinct categories, but instead as two ideal types that define a continuum:  [90]Intrinsic motivation occurs when people are internally motivated to do something because it either brings them pleasure, they think it is important, or they feel that what they are learning is significant.\nIt has been shown that intrinsic motivation for education drops from grades 3-9 though the exact cause cannot be ascertained.\n[91] Also, in younger students it has been shown that contextualizing material that would otherwise be presented in an abstract manner increases the intrinsic motivation of these students.\n[92]Extrinsic motivation comes into play when a student is compelled to do something or act a certain way because of factors external to him or her (like money or good grades).\nCassandra B. Whyte researched and reported about the importance of locus of control and academic achievement.\nStudents tending toward a more internal locus of control are more academically successful, thus encouraging curriculum and activity development with consideration of motivation theories.\n[93]  [94]Academic motivation orientation may also be tied with one's ability to detect and process errors.\nFisher, Nanayakkara, and Marshall conducted neuroscience research on children's motivation orientation, neurological indicators of error monitoring (the process of detecting an error), and academic achievement.\nTheir research suggests that students with high intrinsic motivation attribute performance to personal control and that their error-monitoring system is more strongly engaged by performance errors.\nThey also found that motivation orientation and academic achievement were related to the strength in which their error-monitoring system was engaged.\n[95]Motivation has been found to be an important element in the concept of andragogy  (what motivates the adult learner), and in treating Autism Spectrum Disorders, as in pivotal response treatment.\nMotivation has also been found critical in adolescents compliance to health suggestions, since \"commitment requires belief in potentially negative and serious consequences of not acting\"  [96].\nDoyle and Moeyn have noted that traditional methods tended to use anxiety as negative motivation (e.g.\nuse of bad grades by teachers) as a method of getting students to work.\nHowever, they have found that progressive approaches with focus on positive motivation over punishment has produced greater effectiveness with learning, since anxiety interferes with performance of complex tasks.\n[97]Impact of teaching style on student intrinsic motivation  [ edit]It may appear that the reason some students are more engaged and perform better in class activities relative to other students is because some are more motivated than others.\nHowever, current research suggests that motivation is not concrete or quantifiable; it is \"dynamic, context sensitive, and changeable.\"  [98] Thus, students have the flexibility to intrinsically motivate themselves to engage in an activity or learn something new even if they were not intrinsically motivated in the first place  [99] .\nWhile having this type of flexibility is important, research reveals that a teacher's teaching style and the school environment also play a factor in student motivation  [100];  [101];  [102]According to Sansone and Morgan, when students are already motivated to engage in an activity for their own personal pleasure and then a teacher provides the student with feedback, the type of feedback given can change the way that student views the activity and can even undermine their intrinsic motivation.\n[103]  [104] Maclellan also looked at the relationship between tutors and students and in particular, and the type of feedback the tutor would give to the student.\nMaclellan's results showed that praise or criticism directed towards the student generated a feeling of \"fixed intelligence \" while praise and criticism directed towards the effort and strategy used by the student generated a feeling of \" malleable intelligence \"  [105] .\nIn other words, feedback concerning effort and strategy leaves students knowing that there is room for growth.\nThis is important because when students believe their intelligence is \"fixed\", their mindset can prevent skill development because students will believe that they only have a \"certain amount\" of understanding on a particular subject matter and might not even try.\nTherefore, it's crucial that a teacher is aware of how the feedback they give to their students can both positively and negatively impact the student's engagement and motivation  [106]  [107].\nIn a correlational study, Katz and Shahar used a series of questionnaires and Likert-style scales and gave them to 100 teachers to see what makes a motivating teacher.\nTheir results indicate that teachers who are intrinsically motivated to teach and believe that students should be taught in an autonomous style are the types of teachers that promote intrinsic motivation in the classroom  [108].\nDeci, Sheinman, and Nezlek also found that when teachers adapted to an autonomous teaching style, students were positively affected and became more intrinsically motivated to achieve in the classroom.\nHowever, while the students were quick to adapt to the new teaching style the impact was short-lived  [109] .\nThus, teachers are limited in the way they teach because they'll feel a pressure to act, teach, and provide feedback in a certain way from the school district, administration, and guardians  [110],  [111].\nFurthermore, even if students do have a teacher that promotes an autonomous teaching style, their overall school environment is also a factor because it can be extrinsically motivating.\nExamples of this would be posters around school promoting pizza parties for highest grade point average or longer recess times for the classroom that brings more canned food donations.\nIn conclusion, it is not a matter whether a student is motivated, unmotivated, or more motivated than other students- it's a matter of understanding what motivates students before providing a certain type of feedback.\nFurthermore, it is also important to note that despite the classroom environment and the teacher's teaching style, the overall school environment plays a role in students' intrinsic motivation.\nIndigenous education and learning  [ edit]For many indigenous students (such as Native American children), motivation may be derived from social organization; an important factor educators should account for in addition to variations in sociolinguistics and cognition.\n[112] While poor academic performance among Native American students is often attributed to low levels of motivation, Top-down classroom organization is often found to be ineffective for children of many cultures who depend on a sense of community, purpose, and competence in order to engage.\n[113] Horizontally structured, community-based learning strategies often provide a more structurally supportive environment for motivating indigenous children, who tend to be driven by \"social/affective emphasis, harmony, holistic perspectives, expressive creativity, and nonverbal communication .\"\n[114] This drive is also traceable to a cultural tradition of community-wide expectations of participation in the activities and goals of the greater group, rather than individualized aspirations of success or triumph.\n[115]Also, in some indigenous communities, young children can often portray a sense of community-based motivation through their parent-like interactions with siblings.\n[116] Furthermore, it is commonplace for children to assist and demonstrate for their younger counterparts without being prompted by authority figures.\nObservation techniques and integration methods are demonstrated in such examples as weaving in Chiapas, Mexico, where it is commonplace for children to learn from \"a more skilled other\" within the community.\n[117] The child's real responsibility within the Mayan community can be seen in, for example, weaving apprenticeships; often, when the \"more skilled other\" is tasked with multiple obligations, an older child will step in and guide the learner.\n[117] Sibling guidance is supported from early youth, where learning through play encourages horizontally structured environments through alternative educational models such as \"Intent Community Participation.\"\n[118] Research also suggests that that formal Westernized schooling can actually reshape the traditionally collaborative nature of social life in indigenous communities  [119] This research is supported cross-culturally, with variations in motivation and learning often reported higher between indigenous groups and their national Westernized counterparts than between indigenous groups across international continental divides.\n[120]Also, in some Indigenous communities in the Americas, motivation is a driving force for learning.\nChildren are incorporated and welcomed to participate in daily activities and thus feel motivated to participate due to them seeking a sense of belonging in their families and communities.\n[121]Children's participation is encouraged and their learning is supported by their community and family, furthering their motivation.\nChildren are also trusted to be active contributors.\nTheir active participation allows them to learn and gain skills that are valuable and useful in their communities.\n[122]As children transition from early childhood to middle childhood, their motivation to participate changes.\nIn both the Indigenous communities of Quechua people and Rioja in Peru, children often experience a transition in which they become more included into their family's and community's endeavors.\nThis changes their position and role in their families to more responsible ones and leads to an increase in their eagerness to participate and belong.\nAs children go through this transition, they often develop a sense of identity within their family and community.\n[123]The transition from childhood to adolescence can be seen in the amount of work children partake in as this changes over time.\nFor example, Yucatec Mayan children 's play time decreases from childhood to adolescence and as the child gets older, is replaced for time spent working.\nIn childhood the work is initiated by others whereas in adolescence it is self-initiated.\nThe shift in initiation and the change in time spent working versus playing shows the children's motivation to participate in order to learn.\n[124]This transition between childhood and adolescence increases motivation because children gain social responsibility within their families.\nIn some Mexican communities of Indigenous-heritage, the contributions that children make within their community is essential to being social beings, establishes their developing roles, and also helps with developing their relationship with their family and community.\n[125]As children gain more roles and responsibilities within their families, their eagerness to participate also increases.\nFor example, Young Mayan children of San Pedro, Guatemala learn to work in the fields and family run businesses because they are motivated to contribute to their family.\nMany San Pedro women learned to weave by watching their mothers sew when they were children, sometimes earning their own wool through doing small tasks such as watching young children of busy mothers.\nEager to learn and contribute, these young girls helped other members of their community in order to help their mothers with their weaving businesses or through other tasks such as helping carry water while young boys helped with tasks such as carrying firewood alongside their fathers.\n[126]Children's motivation to learn is not solely influenced on their desire to belong but also their eagerness to see their community succeed.\nChildren from Navajo communities were shown to have higher levels of social concern than Anglo American children in their schools.\nBy having high levels of social concern the indigenous children are showing concern for not only their learning but also their peers', which serves as an example of their instilled sense of responsibility for their community.\nThey wish to succeed as a united group rather than just themselves.\n[127]In order to be knowledgeable contributors, children must be aware of their surroundings and community's goals.\nChildren's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community.\nThrough this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity that they are doing within their community and become active participants because they know they are doing it for their community.\n[128]Self-determination in education  [ edit]Self-determination is the ability to make choices and exercise a high degree of control, such as what the student does and how they do it (Deci et al., 1991; Reeve, Hamm, & Nix, 2003; Ryan & Deci, 2002).\nSelf-determination can be supported by providing opportunities for students to be challenged, such as leadership opportunities, providing appropriate feedback and fostering, establishing and maintaining good relationships between teachers and students.\nThese strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated to study.\nOn the other hand, students who lack self-determination are more likely to feel their success is out of their control.\nSuch students lose motivation to study, which causes a state of \"learned helplessness\".\nStudents who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try.\nOver time, a vicious circle of low achievement develops.\nPhysical activity in education  [ edit]Physical activity is body movement that works your muscles and requires more energy than resting.\nAccording to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation.\nAIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain.\nWith consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly.\nBy performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing.\nAfter exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information.\nIn addition, exercise can relieve stress.\nExercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body.\nWithout stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook.\nThis positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically.\nLastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies.\nAIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised.\nBeing able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.\n[129]Business  [ edit]Main articles: Work motivation and Organizational behavior \u00a7 Motivation\nAt lower levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, such as physiological needs, money is a motivator, however it tends to have a motivating effect on staff that lasts only for a short period (in accordance with Herzberg 's two-factor model of motivation).\nAt higher levels of the hierarchy, praise, respect, recognition, empowerment and a sense of belonging are far more powerful motivators than money, as both Abraham Maslow 's theory of motivation and Douglas Mc\nGregor 's theory X and theory Y  (pertaining to the theory of leadership) demonstrate.\nAccording to Maslow, people are motivated by unsatisfied needs.\n[130] The lower level needs such as Physiological and Safety needs will have to be satisfied before higher level needs are to be addressed.\nWe can relate Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory with employee motivation.\nFor example, if a manager is trying to motivate his employees by satisfying their needs; according to Maslow, he should try to satisfy the lower level needs before he tries to satisfy the upper level needs or the employees will not be motivated.\nAlso he has to remember that not everyone will be satisfied by the same needs.\nA good manager will try to figure out which levels of needs are active for a certain individual or employee.\nMaslow has money at the lowest level of the hierarchy and shows other needs are better motivators to staff.\nMc\nGregor places money in his Theory X category and feels it is a poor motivator.\nPraise and recognition are placed in the Theory Y category and are considered stronger motivators than money.\nMotivated employees always look for better ways to do a job.\nMotivated employees are more quality oriented.\nMotivated workers are more productive.\nThe average workplace is about midway between the extremes of high threat and high opportunity.\nMotivation by threat is a dead-end strategy, and naturally staff are more attracted to the opportunity side of the motivation curve than the threat side.\nMotivation is a powerful tool in the work environment that can lead to employees working at their most efficient levels of production.\n[131]Nonetheless, Steinmetz also discusses three common character types of subordinates: ascendant, indifferent, and ambivalent who all react and interact uniquely, and must be treated, managed, and motivated accordingly.\nAn effective leader must understand how to manage all characters, and more importantly the manager must utilize avenues that allow room for employees to work, grow, and find answers independently.\n[132]The assumptions of Maslow and Herzberg were challenged by a classic study  [133] at Vauxhall Motors' UK manufacturing plant.\nThis introduced the concept of orientation to work and distinguished three main orientations: instrumental (where work is a means to an end), bureaucratic (where work is a source of status, security and immediate reward) and solidaristic (which prioritizes group loyalty).\nOther theories which expanded and extended those of Maslow and Herzberg included Kurt Lewin 's force-field analysis, Edwin A. Locke 's goal-setting theory and Victor Vroom 's expectancy theory.\nThese tend to stress cultural differences and the fact that individuals tend to be motivated by different factors at different times.\n[134]According to the system of scientific management developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor, a worker's motivation is solely determined by pay, and therefore management need not consider psychological or social aspects of work.\nIn essence, scientific management bases human motivation wholly on extrinsic rewards and discards the idea of intrinsic rewards.\nIn contrast, David Mc\nClelland believed that workers could not be motivated by the mere need for money \u2014in fact, extrinsic motivation  (e.g., money) could extinguish intrinsic motivation such as achievement motivation, though money could be used as an indicator of success for various motives, e.g., keeping score.\nIn keeping with this view, his consulting firm, Mc\nBer & Company, had as its first motto \"To make everyone productive, happy, and free.\"\nFor Mc\nClelland, satisfaction lay in aligning a person's life with their fundamental motivations.\nElton Mayo found that the social contacts a worker has at the workplace are very important and that boredom and repetitiveness of tasks lead to reduced motivation.\nMayo believed that workers could be motivated by acknowledging their social needs and making them feel important.\nAs a result, employees were given freedom to make decisions on the job and greater attention was paid to informal work groups.\nMayo named the model the Hawthorne effect.\nHis model has been judged as placing undue reliance on social contacts within work situations for motivating employees.\n[135]William Ouchi introduced Theory Z, a hybrid management approach consisting of both Japanese and American philosophies and cultures.\n[136] Its Japanese segment is much like the clan culture where organizations focus on a standardized structure with heavy emphasis on socialization of its members.\nAll underlying goals are consistent across the organization.\nIts American segment retains formality and authority amongst members and the organization.\nUltimately, Theory Z promotes common structure and commitment to the organization, as well as constant improvement of work efficacy.\nIn Essentials of Organizational Behavior, Robbins and Judge examine recognition programs as motivators, and identify five principles that contribute to the success of an employee incentive program:  [137]Recognition of employees' individual differences, and clear identification of behavior deemed worthy of recognition\nAllowing employees to participate\nLinking rewards to performance\nRewarding of nominators\nVisibility of the recognition process\nModern organizations adopt non-monetary employee motivation methods rather than tying it with tangible rewards.\nProvide a positive work environment\nEncourage team contribution and rewards\nFeedback\nGive challenging roles\nEmpowering employees with training and independent thinking\nThis method makes employees feel they're a part of the organization and their reward is seeing it grow through their efforts.\n[138]Games  [ edit]Motivational models are central to game design, because without motivation, a player will not be interested in progressing further within a game.\n[139] Several models for gameplay motivations have been proposed, including Richard Bartle's.\nJon Radoff has proposed a four-quadrant model of gameplay motivation that includes cooperation, competition, immersion and achievement.\n[140] The motivational structure of games is central to the gamification trend, which seeks to apply game-based motivation to business applications.\n[141] In the end, game designers must know the needs and desires of their customers for their companies to flourish.\nThere have been various studies on the connection between motivation and games.\nOne particular study was on Taiwanese adolescents and their drive of addiction to games.\nTwo studies by the same people were conducted.\nThe first study revealed that addicted players showed higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation and more intrinsic motivation than the non-addicted players.\n[142] It can then be said that addicted players, according to the studies findings, are more internally motivated to play games.\nThey enjoy the reward of playing.\nThere are studies that also show that motivation gives these players more to look for in the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.\n[143]See also  [ edit]Adaptive performance\nAddiction\nAmotivational syndrome\nEquity theory\nFrustration\nHappiness at work\nHealth action process

Flag\nWhat were James Buchanan's accomplishments?\nAnswer by Dark\nSoul100 Confidence votes 980Buchanan accomplished little in his presidency and came across as inept to many following \"Bleeding Kansas.\"\nBuchanan was the last pre-Civil War president.\nHis time in office was filled with handling the increasingly contentious sectionalism of the time.\nThe Confederate States of America were created while he was President after Abraham Lincoln was elected in November, 1860.\nHe did not take an aggressive stance at all against the states that seceded and instead attempted reconciliation without war.\nEvents and Accomplishments of James Budhanan's Presidency: The Dred Scott court case occurred at the beginning of his administration which stated that slaves were considered property.\nDespite being against slavery himself, Buchanan felt that this case proved the constitutionality of slavery.\nHe fought for Kansas to be entered into the union as a slave state but it was eventually admitted as a free state in 1861.\nIn 1857, an economic depression occurred called the Panic of 1857.\nThe North and West were hit hard but Buchanan took no action to help alleviate the depression.\nBy the time for reelection, Buchanan had decided not to run again.\nHe knew that he had lost support, and he was unable to stop the problems that would lead to secession.\nHe obviously wanted to preserve the Union, at all costs, and was unable to even make a beginning of this.6 people found this useful\nWas this answer useful?\nYes\nSomewhat\nNo\n\n",

    "document": "What Causes Loose Stools or Diarrhea in a Horse What Causes Loose Stools or Diarrhea in a Horse\nLoose stools in a horse or pony, if they are infrequent, are usually due to stress or nervousness.\nLoose or 'squittery' droppings often occur when a horse is asked to do something that causes it anxiety such as being loaded into a trailer or anticipation when being prepared for travelling to a horse show.\nHowever loose stools in a horse can also be caused by factors other than anxiety or stress:\nThe horse or pony could have eaten a poisonous plant.\nThere are common trees and plants that are poisonous to horses.\nSome of these are only mildly poisonous - but others can be fatal.\nCheck your grazing for plants, or call in an expert to check the pasture for you.\nStraw bedding can cause irritation of the horse's intestinal tract if it is eaten.\nIf you know that your horse eats straw it may be best to change to a different type of bedding.\nA sudden change of diet - such as feeding a bran mash.\nGiving your horse too many treats such as apples can also cause loose stools.\nLoose stools can also be a symptom of sand colic.\nA diet too rich or high in protein can also be a cause of 'squittery' droppings.\nCALLING THE VET WHEN YOU HORSE HAS LOOSE STOOLSIf the loose stools are not related to the horse becoming nervous and are occuring every day then you will need to call your vet who will give a proper diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment.\nThe vet will give advice on medicine and how to treat the horse for diarrhea.\nPREVENTION OF LOOSE STOOLSIf the problem is due to stress or anxiety try giving you horse a magnesium calmer or add calming herbs to his feed.\nAdding equine probiotics to your horse's feed will help to maintain a healthy gut and lessen the chances that he will suffer from diarrhea.\n\n",

    "document": "White Rabbit (song) White Rabbit is a song written in 1966 by Grace Slick.\nIt became well known after Slick recorded it with her band, Jefferson Airplane, a year later.\nThe song was released as a single and appears on the album \"Surrealistic Pillow.\" It includes comparisons of the hallucinatory effects of psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin mushrooms with the imagery found in the fantasy works of Lewis Carroll: 1865's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its 1871 sequel Through the Looking-Glass.\nEvents in these books, such as changing size after eating mushrooms or drinking an unknown liquid, are referenced in the song.\nCharacters referenced include Alice, the hookah-smoking caterpillar, The White Knight, the Red Queen, and the Dormouse .\nFor Grace and others in the '60s, drugs were an inevitable part of mind-expanding and social experimentation.\nWith its enigmatic lyrics, White Rabbit became one of the first songs to sneak drug references past censors on the radio.\nEven Marty Balin, Grace's eventual rival in the Airplane, regarded the song as a \"masterpiece.\" In interviews, Grace has related that \"Alice in Wonderland\" was often read to her as a child and remained a vivid memory into her adult years.\nThe drug references in this song are mentioned in the popular young adult book Go Ask Alice, in which the narrator (an unnamed teenage girl) wonders if Carroll, himself had been on drugs when he wrote the novels.\nCategories:\nSongs\n\n",

about refrigerated urine, but room temperature only 8 hours?\nWhen I do urine collections, sometimes I collect after hours in the evenings (reasonable suspicion or post accident).\nThe specimen sits in my facility (in the \"out box\") until the delivery service comes the next day (after 4:00 p.m.).\nThen it is put on a plane and flown to whatever lab it is destined for.\nThat means the specimen (urine) has been sitting at my facility for up to 20 hours, then on a plane for ??\n?, then at the lab for a few hours while it is cataloged and tested.\nAll at room temp (except for the plane ride in the cargo hold).\nNone have ever come back to me as \"no good\" or \"expired\".\nI actually have no idea how long urine can be kept at room temp, refrigerated, or frozen.\nI do know that I keep urine longer than 8 hours until the delivery service gets here.\nMost collection sites have scheduled pick up once per day with their delivery service.\nMaybe someone who works at a lab or has done some research into this subject can shed some light on the subject for us.\nSecs, Feb 3, 2006#9Hawg Sr. Memberi have always heard a week in the fridge but like you Buzzby i am not sure where I came across that info either.\nAs far as room temp, Sec3 might know but do the collection sites have a test to tell how long?\nI thought someone said the proteins in the urine start breaking down after so long at room temp.\nMaybe since it was collected at an accredited collection site they do not test it to see if it has been setting around.\nNot sure just some random thoughts.\nHawg, Feb 3,

    "document": "Adrenergic antagonist From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search\nVisual definition of an antagonist, where it compared to agonists and reverse agonists.\nAn adrenergic antagonist is a drug that inhibits the function of adrenergic receptors.\nThere are five adrenergic receptors, which are divided into two groups.\nThe first group of receptors are the beta (\u03b2) adrenergic receptors.\nThere are \u03b2 1, \u03b2 2, and \u03b2 3 receptors.\nThe second group contains the alpha (\u03b1) adrenoreceptors.\nThere are only \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 receptors.\nAdrenergic receptors are located near the heart, kidneys, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.\n[1] There are also \u03b1-adreno receptors that are located on vascular smooth muscle.\n[2]Antagonists reduce or block the signals of agonists.\nThey can be drugs, which are added to the body for therapeutic reasons, or endogenous ligands.\nThe \u03b1-adrenergic antagonists have different effects from the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists.\nContents1 Pharmacology2 Mechanisms of action2.1 Competitive2.1.1 Examples2.2 Non-competitive2.3 Uncompetitive3 Examples3.1 Alpha blockers3.2 Beta blockers3.3 Mixed action4 Major effects5 Medical uses6 Limitations7 Side effects and toxicity8 See also9 References10 External links\nPharmacology  [ edit]Adrenergic ligands are endogenous proteins that modulate and evoke specific cardiovascular effects.\nAdrenergic antagonists reverse the natural cardiovascular effect, based on the type of adrenoreceptor being blocked.\nFor example, if the natural activation of the \u03b1 1 -adrenergic receptor leads to vasoconstriction, an \u03b1 1 -adrenergic antagonist will result in vasodilation.\n[3]Some adrenergic antagonists, mostly \u03b2 antagonists, passively diffuse from the gastrointestinal tract.\nFrom there, they bind to albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein in the plasma, allowing for a wide spread through the body.\nFrom there, the lipophilic antagonists are metabolized in the liver and eliminated with urine while the hydrophilic ones are eliminated unchanged.\n[4]Mechanisms of action  [ edit]There are three different types of antagonists.\nCompetitive  [ edit]While only a few \u03b1-adrenergic antagonists are competitive, all \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists are competitive antagonists.\n[5]  [6] Competitive antagonists are a type of reversible antagonists.\nA competitive antagonist will attach itself to the same binding site of the receptor that the agonist will bind to.\nEven though it is in activator region, the antagonist will not activate the receptor.\nThis type of binding is reversible as increasing the concentration of agonist will outcompete the concentration of antagonist, resulting in receptor activation.\n[7]Adrenergic competitive antagonists are shorter lasting than the other two types of antagonists.\nWhile the antagonists for alpha and beta receptors are usually different compounds, there has been recent drug development that effects both types of the adrenoreceptors.\nPhentolamine, an adrenergic antagonist\nExamples  [ edit]Two examples of competitive adrenergic antagonists are propranolol and phentolamine.\nPhentolamine is a competitive and nonselective \u03b1-adrenoreceptor antagonist.\nPropanalol is a \u03b2-adreno receptor antagonist.\n[8]Non-competitive  [ edit]While competitive antagonists bind to the agonist or ligand binding site of the receptor reversibly, non-competitive antagonists can either bind to the ligand site or other site called the allosteric site.\nA receptor's agonist does not bind to its allosteric binding site.\nThe binding of a non-competitive antagonist is irreversible.\nIf the non-competitive antagonist binds to the allosteric site and an agonist binds to the ligand site, the receptor will remain unactivated.\n[9]  [10]An example of an adrenergic non competitive antagonists is phenoxybenzamine.\nThis drug is a non-selective \u03b1-adrenergic antagonist, which means it binds to both alpha receptors.\n[11]Uncompetitive  [ edit]There are few if any adrenergic uncompetitive antagonists.\nAn uncompetitive antagonist is slightly different from the other two types of antagonists.\nThe action of an uncompetitive antagonist is dependent on the receptor's prior activation.\nThis means only after the agonist binds to the receptor can the antagonist block the receptor's function.\n[12]Examples  [ edit]Alpha blockers  [ edit]Phentolamine\nBeta blockers  [ edit]Propranolol  [13]Nebivilol  [13]Atenolol  [13]Oxprenolol  [13]Metoprolol  [13]Timolol  [4]Pindolol  [4]Nadolol  [4]Pindolol  [4]Esmolol  [4]Acebutolol  [4]Sotalol  [4]Talinolol  [4]Betaxolol  [4]Mixed action  [ edit]Labetalol  [4]Carvedilol  [4]Major effects  [ edit]Major complications of persistent high blood pressure, which can be attenuated by adrenergic antagonists.\nAdrenergic antagonists have inhibitory or opposing effects on the receptors in the adrenergic system.\nThe adrenergic system modulates the fight-or-flight response.\nSince this response, which is mostly seen as an increase in blood pressure, is produced by the release of the endogenous adrenergic ligands, administration of an adrenergic antagonist results a decrease in blood pressure, which is controlled by both heart rate and vasculature tone.\n[14] Administration of an adrenergic antagonist that specifically targets the beta receptors, results in this decrease in blood pressure by slowing or reducing cardiac output.\n[15]Medical uses  [ edit]Adrenergic antagonists are mostly used for cardiovascular disease.\nThe adrenergic antagonists are widely used for lowering blood pressure and relieving hypertension.\n[16] These antagonists have a been proven to relieve the pain caused by myocardial infarction, and also the infarction size, which correlates with heart rate.\n[17]There are few non-cardiovascular uses for adrenergic antagonists.\nAlpha-adrenergic antagonists are also used for treatment of ureteric stones, pain and panic disorders, withdrawal, and anesthesia.\n[18]  [2]Limitations  [ edit]While these adrenergic antagonists are used for treating cardiovascular disease, mainly hypertension, they can evoke harmful cardiac events.\nSome adrenergic antagonists have a diminished ability to reduce stroke compared to placebo drugs.\n[13]Side effects and toxicity  [ edit]While adrenergic antagonists have been used for years, there are multiple issues with using this class of drug.\nWhen overused, adrenergic antagonists can result in bradycardia, hypotension, hyperglycemia and even hypodynamic shock.\nThis is because adrenergic stimulation by agonists, results in normal calcium channel regulation.\nIf these adrenergic receptors are blocked too often, there will be an excess in calcium channel inhibition, which causes most of these problems.\n[19]See also  [ edit]Adrenergic receptor\nAlpha blocker\nAntagonist\nBeta

    "document": "Hadrian by Joshua J.\nMark published on 02 September 2009Hadrian was Roman emperor from 117 to 138 CE and he is known as the third of the Five Good Emperors ( Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius) who ruled justly.\nBorn Publius Aelius Hadrianus, probably in Hispania, Hadrian is best known for his substantial building projects throughout the Roman Empire and, especially, Hadrian's Wall in northern Britain.\nEarly Life\nAs a young man, Hadrian was well educated in his hometown of Italica Hispania (modern day Seville, Spain) and left for Rome around the age of 14.\nHis first military service was as Tribune under Emperor Nerva.\nWhen Nerva died, Trajan ascended to the throne.\nEmperor Trajan was the first Roman ruler of provincial origin.\nLater biographers would attempt to place the birth of both Trajan and Hadrian in the city of Rome but both were of Hispanic ethnicity and this commonality has been assumed by some to be the reason for Trajan's adoption of Hadrian as his successor (though most scholars dispute this).\nTrajan died on campaign in Cilicia in 117 CE, with Hadrian in command of his rear guard, and is not believed to have named a successor.\nTrajan's wife, Plotina (who was fond of Hadrian) signed the papers of succession and it is thought that she, not the emperor, was responsible for Hadrian's adoption as heir.\nHowever that may be, it is known that Trajan respected Hadrian and had considered him as his successor even if he did not officially name him as such.\nHadrian's service to Trajan is well documented through the various important positions he held prior to becoming emperor of Rome.\nHadrian is commonly depicted in military attire even though his regime is marked by relative peace.\nHadrian As Emperor\nHis popularity as emperor is attested to by the fact that Hadrian was absent from Rome for the better part of his reign.\nEarlier Roman rulers, such as Nero, were harshly criticized for spending less time away from the city.\nProfessor D. Brendan Nagle writes that Hadrian \"spent most of his reign (twelve out of twenty-one years) traveling all over the Empire visiting the provinces, overseeing the administration, and checking the discipline of the army.\nHe was a brilliant administrator who concerned himself with all aspects of government and the administration of justice\" (278).\nHis devotion to the army was such that he would sleep and eat among the common soldiers and he is commonly depicted in military attire even though his regime is marked by relative peace.\nHadrian's building projects are perhaps his most enduring legacy.\nHe established cities throughout the Balkan Peninsula, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Greece.\nHis love for Greece and Greek literature was such that he was known as `Graeculus' (Greekling) in his youth and his philhellenism did not dissipate with age.\nHe visited Greece at least twice (probably more) and participated in the Eleusinian Mysteries, of which he was an initiate.\nThe Arch of Hadrian, constructed by the citizens of Athens in 131/132 CE, honor Hadrian as the founder of the city.\nInscriptions on the arch name Theseus  (the traditional founder) but add Hadrian owing to the latter's substantial contributions to Athens (such as the Temple of Zeus ).\nHe dedicated a number of sites in Greece to his young lover Antinous, who drowned in the Nile River in 130 CE.\nHadrian was deeply attached to Antinous and the young man's death so greatly affected the emperor that he had him deified (from which the mystery cult in honor of Antinous grew).\nIn Egypt he founded the city of Antinopolis in his memory.\nIn Rome he rebuilt the Pantheon  (which had been destroyed by fire) and Trajan's Forum as well as funding construction of other buildings, baths, and villas.\nMany of these structures survived intact for centuries, some as late as the 19th century CE, and the Pantheon, still perfectly preserved, may be visited in the present day.\nHadrian had a great interest in architecture and seems to have contributed ideas, or even plans, to the architects though scholars no longer believe that he was the lead architect on any single project.\nHadrian\nHadrian's Wall\nOf all his significant monuments and buildings, Hadrian's Wall in north Britain is the most famous.\nConstruction of the wall, known in antiquity as Vallum Hadriani, was begun around 122 CE and corresponded to Hadrian's visit to the province.\nIt marked the northern boundary of the Roman Empire in Britain but the length and breadth of the project (stretching, as it did, from coast to coast) suggests that the more important purpose of the wall was a show of Rome's power.\nThe wall was originally 9.7 feet wide (3 metres) and 16-20 feet high (six metres) east of the River Irthing, all built of stone, and 20 feet wide (6 metres) by 11.feet high (3.5 metres) west of the river, made up of stone and turf, stretching 73 miles (120 km) across uneven terrain.\nIt was built in six years by the legions stationed in Britain.\nThere were between 14-17 fortifications along the length of the wall and a Vallum (a ditch purposefully constructed of earthworks) which ran parallel to the wall.\nThe Vallum measured 20 feet (6 metres) wide by 10 feet (3 metres) deep flanked by large mounds of tightly packed earth.\nAs Hadrian's foreign policy was \"peace through strength\" it is thought that the wall, which was originally plastered and white washed, would have clearly represented the might of the Roman Empire.\nJerusalem\nAlthough Hadrian was a learned and cultivated man, his policy of peaceful relations and negotiations was not always adhered to.\nIn 130 CE, Hadrian visited Jerusalem, which was still in ruins from the First Roman-Jewish War of 66-73 CE.\nHe rebuilt the city according to his own designs and renamed it Aelia Capitolina Jupiter Capitolinus after himself and the king of the Roman gods.\nWhen he built a temple to Jupiter on the ruins of the Temple of Solomon  (the so-called Second Temple, considered sacred by the Jews), the populace rose up under the leadership of Simon bar Kokhbah in what has come to be known as bar Kokhbah's Revolt (132-136 CE).\nRoman losses in this campaign were enormous but Jewish losses were no less significant.\nBy the time the rebellion was put down, 580,000 Jews had been killed and over 1000 towns and villages destroyed.\nHadrian then banished the remaining Jews from the region and renamed it Syria Palaestina after the traditional enemies of the Jewish people, the Philistines.\nHe ordered a public burning of the Torah, executed the Jewish scholars, and prohibited the practice and observance of Judaism.\nHadrian in Military Armour\nDeath & Successor\nHis health now failing, Hadrian returned to Rome and occupied himself by writing poetry and tending to administrative affairs.\nHe named as his successor Antoninus Pius on the stipulation that Antoninus would adopt the young Marcus Aurelius to follow.\nHadrian died in 138 CE, presumably of a heart attack, at the age of 62.\nHe was buried first at Puteoli, on the grounds of the former estate of the Rhetorician Cicero  (as homage to Hadrian's love of learning) but when Antoninus Pius completed the great Tomb of Hadrian in Rome the following year, his body was cremated and the ashes interred there with his wife and son.\nAntoninus Pius had Hadrian deified and temples built in his honor.\nThe historian Gibbon writes that Hadrian's rule was, \"the period in the history of the world during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous\u2026when the vast extent of the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom\" (61).\nAlthough Hadrian was not universally admired during his life, or since his death, his reign is generally considered in keeping with Gibbon's estimation.\nEditorial Review This Article has been reviewed for accuracy, reliability and adherence to

one state of water within the hydrosphere.\nWater vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice.\nUnlike other forms of water, water vapor is invisible.\n[4] Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation.\nIt is lighter than air and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds.\nBeing a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in Earth's atmosphere where it is also a potent greenhouse gas along with other gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.\nUse of water vapor, as steam, has been important to humans for cooking and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the industrial revolution.\nWater vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, present even in the solar atmosphere as well as every planet in the Solar System and many astronomical objects including natural satellites, comets and even large asteroids.\nLikewise the detection of extrasolar water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems.\nWater vapor is significant in that it can be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects.\nContents [ hide ]1 Properties1.1 Evaporation1.2 Sublimation1.3

molecule leaves a surface and diffuses into a surrounding gas, it is said to have evaporated.\nEach individual water molecule which transitions between a more associated (liquid) and a less associated (vapor/gas) state does so through the absorption or release of kinetic energy.\nThe aggregate measurement of this kinetic energy transfer is defined as thermal energy and occurs only when there is differential in the temperature of the water molecules.\nLiquid water that becomes water vapor takes a parcel of heat with it, in a process called evaporative cooling.\n[5] The amount of water vapor in the air determines how frequently molecules will return to the surface.\nWhen a net evaporation occurs, the body of water will undergo a net cooling directly related to the loss of water.\nIn the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized \"pan\" open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide.\nOthers do likewise around the world.\nThe US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map.\n[6] The measurements range from under 30 to over 120 inches per year.\nFormulas can be used for calculating the rate of evaporation from a water surface such as a swimming pool.\n[7]  [8] In some countries, the evaporation rate far exceeds the precipitation rate.\nEvaporative cooling is restricted by atmospheric conditions.\nHumidity is the amount of water vapor in the air.\nThe vapor content of air is measured with devices known as hygrometers.\nThe measurements are usually expressed as specific humidity or percent relative humidity.\nThe temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure.\nThis condition is often referred to as complete saturation.\nHumidity ranges from 0 gram per cubic metre in dry air to 30 grams per cubic metre (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30 \u00b0C.\n[9] (See also Absolute Humidity table)  [10]Recovery of meteorites in Antarctica ( ANSMET) Electron micrograph of freeze-etched capillary tissue\nSublimation  [ edit]Sublimation is when water molecules directly leave the surface of ice without first becoming liquid water.\nSublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting.\nAntarctica shows this effect to a unique degree because it is by far the continent with the lowest rate of precipitation on Earth.\nAs a result, there are large areas where millennial layers of snow have sublimed, leaving behind whatever non-volatile materials they had contained.\nThis is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines, a dramatic example being the collection of meteorites that are left exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation.\nSublimation is important in the preparation of certain classes of biological specimens for scanning electron microscopy.\nTypically the specimens are prepared by cryofixation and freeze-fracture, after which the broken surface is freeze-etched, being eroded by exposure to vacuum till it shows the required level of detail.\nThis technique can display protein molecules, organelle structures and lipid bilayers with very low degrees of distortion.\nCondensation  [ edit]Clouds, formed by condensed water vapor\nWater vapor will only condense onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the dew point temperature, or when the water vapor equilibrium in air has been exceeded.\nWhen water vapor condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface.\nThe water molecule brings heat energy with it.\nIn turn, the temperature of the atmosphere drops slightly.\n[11] In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by cloud condensation nuclei ).\nThe dew point of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapor in the air begins to condense concluding water vapor is a type of water or rain.\nAlso, a net condensation of water vapor occurs on surfaces when the temperature of the surface is at or below the dew point temperature of the atmosphere.\nDeposition is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapor.\nFrost and snow are examples of deposition.\nChemical reactions  [ edit]A number of chemical reactions have water as a product.\nIf the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the dew point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below the dew point local condensation will occur.\nTypical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of hydrogen or hydrocarbons in air or other oxygen containing gas mixtures, or as a result of reactions with oxidizers.\nIn a similar fashion other chemical or physical reactions can take place in the presence of water vapor resulting in new chemicals forming such as rust on iron or steel, polymerization occurring (certain polyurethane foams and cyanoacrylate glues cure with exposure to atmospheric humidity) or forms changing such as where anhydrous chemicals may absorb enough vapor to form a crystalline structure or alter an existing one, sometimes resulting in characteristic color changes that can be used for measurement.\nMeasurement  [ edit]Measuring the quantity of water vapor in a medium can be done directly or remotely with varying degrees of accuracy.\nRemote methods such electromagnetic absorption are possible from satellites above planetary atmospheres.\nDirect methods may use electronic transducers, moistened thermometers or hygroscopic materials measuring changes in physical properties or dimensions.medium temperature range (deg\nC) measurement uncertaintytypical measurement frequency system cost notessling psychrometer

air density  [ edit]Water vapor is lighter or less dense than dry air.\n[12]  [13] At equivalent temperatures it is buoyant with respect to dry air, whereby the density of dry air at standard temperature and pressure is 1.27 g/L and water vapor at standard temperature and pressure has the much lower density of 0.804 g/L.\nCalculations  [ edit]Water vapor and dry air density calculations at 0 \u00b0C:\nThe molar mass of water is 18.02 g/mol, as calculated from the sum of the atomic masses of its constituent atoms.\nThe average molecular mass of air (approx.\n78% nitrogen, N 2; 21% oxygen, O 2; 1% other gases) is 28.57 g/mol at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ).\nUsing Avogadro's Law and the ideal gas law, water vapor and air will have a molar volume of 22.414 L/mol at STP.\nA molar mass of air and water vapor occupy the same volume of 22.414 litres.\nThe density  (mass/volume) of water vapor is 0.804 g/L, which is significantly less than that of dry air at 1.27 g/L at STP.\nThis means water vapor is lighter than air.\nSTP conditions imply a temperature of 0 \u00b0C, at which the ability of water to become vapor is very restricted.\nIts concentration in air is very low at 0 \u00b0C.\nThe red line on the chart to the right is the maximum concentration of water vapor expected for a given temperature.\nThe water vapor concentration increases significantly as the temperature rises, approaching 100% ( steam, pure water vapor) at 100 \u00b0C.\nHowever the difference in densities between air and water vapor would still exist.\nAt equal temperatures  [ edit]At the same temperature, a column of dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air containing any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen both being greater than the molar mass of water.\nThus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air.\nAlso, a volume of moist air will rise or be buoyant if placed in a larger region of dry air.\nAs the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase.\nThe increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25 \u00b0C or above.\nThis phenomenon provides a significant driving force for cyclonic and anticyclonic weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).\nRespiration and breathing  [ edit]Water vapor is a by-product of respiration in plants and animals.\nIts contribution to the pressure, increases as its concentration increases.\nIts partial pressure contribution to air pressure increases, lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other atmospheric gases  (Dalton's Law).\nThe total air pressure must remain constant.\nThe presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases.\nThis can have an effect on respiration.\nIn very warm air (35 \u00b0C) the proportion of water vapor is large enough to give rise to the stuffiness that can be experienced in humid jungle conditions or in poorly ventilated buildings.\nLifting gas  [ edit]Water vapor has lower density than that of air and is therefore buoyant in air but has lower vapor pressure than that of air.\nWhen water vapor is used as a lifting gas by a thermal airship the water vapor is heated to form steam so that its vapor pressure is greater than the surrounding air pressure in order to maintain the shape of a theoretical \"steam balloon\", which yields approximately 60% the lift of helium and twice that of hot air.\n[14]General discussion  [ edit]The amount of water vapor in an atmosphere is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature.\nDew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the water cycle.\nEnergy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice on top of a mountain.\nThe balance between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called vapor partial pressure.\nThe maximum partial pressure ( saturation pressure) of water vapor in air varies with temperature of the air and water vapor mixture.\nA variety of empirical formulas exist for this quantity; the most used reference formula is the Goff-Gratch equation for the SVP over liquid water below zero degree Celsius:\nWhere T, temperature of the moist air, is given in units of kelvin, and p is given in units of millibars  ( hectopascals ).\nThe formula is valid from about \u221250 to 102 \u00b0C; however there are a very limited number of measurements of the vapor pressure of water over supercooled liquid water.\nThere are a number of other formulae which can be used.\n[15]Under certain conditions, such as when the boiling temperature of water is reached, a net evaporation will always occur during standard atmospheric conditions regardless of the percent of relative humidity.\nThis immediate process will dispel massive amounts of water vapor into a cooler atmosphere.\nExhaled air is almost fully at equilibrium with water vapor at the body temperature.\nIn the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses, thus showing up as a fog or mist of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces.\nForcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled breath is the basis of exhaled breath condensate, an evolving medical diagnostic test.\nControlling water vapor in air is a key concern in the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning  (HVAC) industry.\nThermal comfort depends on the moist air conditions.\nNon-human comfort situations are called refrigeration, and also are affected by water vapor.\nFor example, many food stores, like supermarkets, utilize open chiller cabinets, or food cases, which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure (lowering humidity).\nThis practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.\nIn Earth's atmosphere  [ edit]Evidence for increasing amounts of stratospheric water vapor over time in Boulder, Colorado.\nFurther information: Atmosphere of Earth\nGaseous water represents a small but environmentally significant constituent of the atmosphere.\nThe percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42 \u00b0C (-44 \u00b0F)  [16] to 4.24% when the dew point is 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F).\n[17] Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the troposphere.\nThe condensation of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for clouds, rain, snow, and other precipitation, all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather.\nLess obviously, the latent heat of vaporization, which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, is one of the most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales.\nFor example, latent heat release in atmospheric convection is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as tropical cyclones and severe thunderstorms.\nWater vapor is the most potent greenhouse gas owing to the presence of the hydroxyl bond which strongly absorbs in the infra-red region of the light spectrum.\nWater in Earth's atmosphere is not merely below its boiling point (100 \u00b0C), but at altitude it goes below its freezing point (0 \u00b0C), due to water's highly polar attraction.\nWhen combined with its quantity, water vapor then has a relevant dew point and frost point, unlike e. g., carbon dioxide and methane.\nWater vapor thus has a scale height a fraction of that of the bulk atmosphere,  [18]  [19]  [20] as the water condenses and exits, primarily in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere.\n[21] Carbon dioxide ( CO 2) and methane, being non-polar, rise above water vapor.\nThe absorption and emission of both compounds contribute to Earth's emission to space, and thus the planetary greenhouse effect.\n[19]  [22]  [23] This greenhouse forcing is directly observable, via distinct spectral features versus water vapor, and observed to be rising with rising CO 2 levels.\n[24] Conversely, adding water vapor at high altitudes has a disproportionate impact, which is why methane (rising, then oxidizing to CO 2 and two water molecules) and jet traffic  [25]  [26]  [27] have disproportionately high warming effects.\nIt is less clear how cloudiness would respond to a warming climate; depending on the nature of the response, clouds could either further amplify or partly mitigate warming from long-lived greenhouse gases.\nIn the absence of other greenhouse gases, Earth's water vapor would condense to the surface;  [28]  [29]  [30] this has likely happened, possibly more than once.\nScientists thus distinguish between non-condensable (driving) and condensable (driven) greenhouse gases- i. e., the above water vapor feedback.\n[31]  [32]  [33]Fog and clouds form through condensation around cloud condensation nuclei.\nIn the absence of nuclei, condensation will only occur at much lower temperatures.\nUnder persistent condensation or deposition, cloud droplets or snowflakes form, which precipitate when they reach a critical mass.\nThe water content of the atmosphere as a whole is constantly depleted by precipitation.\nAt the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation, most prominently from seas, lakes, rivers, and moist earth.\nOther sources of atmospheric water include combustion, respiration, volcanic eruptions, the transpiration of plants, and various other biological and geological processes.\nThe mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25 mm deep.\nThe mean annual precipitation for the planet is about 1 meter, which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air \u2013 on average, the residence time of a water molecule in the troposphere is about 9 to 10 days.\nEpisodes of surface geothermal activity, such as volcanic eruptions and geysers, release variable amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere.\nSuch eruptions may be large in human terms, and major explosive eruptions may inject exceptionally large masses of water exceptionally high into the atmosphere, but as a percentage of total atmospheric water, the role of such processes is minor.\nThe relative concentrations of the various gases emitted by volcanoes varies considerably according to the site and according to the particular event at any one site.\nHowever, water vapor is consistently the commonest volcanic gas; as a rule, it comprises more than 60% of total emissions during a subaerial eruption.\n[34]Atmospheric water vapor content is expressed using various measures.\nThese include vapor pressure, specific humidity, mixing ratio, dew point temperature, and relative humidity.\nRadar and satellite imaging  [ edit]These maps show the average amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere in a given month.\n( click for more detail)MODIS / Terra global mean atmospheric water vapor\nBecause water molecules absorb microwaves and other radio wave frequencies, water in the atmosphere attenuates radar signals.\n[35] In addition, atmospheric water will reflect and refract signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor, liquid or solid.\nGenerally, radar signals lose strength progressively the farther they travel through the troposphere.\nDifferent frequencies attenuate at different rates, such that some components of air are opaque to some frequencies and transparent to others.\nRadio waves used for broadcasting and other communication experience the same effect.\nWater vapor reflects radar to a lesser extent than do water's other two phases.\nIn the form of drops and ice crystals, water acts as a prism, which it does not do as an individual molecule; however, the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere causes the atmosphere to act as a giant prism.\n[36]A comparison of GOES-12 satellite images shows the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth.\nVapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed.\nThe image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the precipitable water or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense.\nThe lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue.\nAreas of missing data appear in shades of gray.\nThe maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite.\nThe most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor.\nIn the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change.\nThis band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds.\nFarther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter.\nAnother pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do.\nThis is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean.\nWater vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.\n[37]As water vapour absorbs light in the visible spectral range, its absorption can be used in spectroscopic applications (such as DOAS) to determine the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.\nThis is done operationally, e.g.\nfrom the GOME spectrometers on ERS and Met\nOp.\n[38] The weaker water vapor absorption lines in the blue spectral range and further into the UV up to its dissociation limit around 243 nm are mostly based on quantum mechanical calculations  [39] and are only partly confirmed by experiments.\n[40]Lightning generation  [ edit]See also: Van de Graaff generator and Extraterrestrial liquid water\nWater vapor plays a key role in lightning production in the atmosphere.\nFrom cloud physics, usually, clouds are the real generators of static charge as found in Earth's atmosphere.\nBut the ability, or capability of clouds to hold massive amounts of electrical energy is directly related to the amount of water vapor present in the local system.\nThe amount of water vapor directly controls the permittivity of the air.\nDuring times of low humidity, static discharge is quick and easy.\nDuring times of higher humidity, fewer static discharges occur.\nPermittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of lightning.\n[41]After a cloud, for instance, has started its way to becoming a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or insulator) that decreases the ability of the cloud to discharge its electrical energy.\nOver a certain amount of time, if the cloud continues to generate and store more static electricity, the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy.\n[42] This energy will be released to a locally, oppositely charged region in the form of lightning.\nThe strength of each discharge is directly related to the atmospheric permittivity, capacitance, and the source's charge generating ability.\n[43]Extraterrestrial  [ edit]Further information: Extraterrestrial liquid water\nWater vapor is common in the Solar System and by extension, other planetary systems.\nIts signature has been detected in the atmospheres of the Sun, occurring in sunspots.\nThe presence of water vapor has been detected in the atmospheres of all seven extraterrestrial planets in the solar system, the Earth's Moon,  [44] and the moons of other planets,  [ which?]\nalthough typically in only trace amounts.\nCryogeyser erupting on Jupiter's moon Europa  (artist concept)  [45]Artist's illustration of the signatures of water in exoplanet atmospheres detectable by instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope.\n[46]Geological formations such as cryogeysers are thought to exist on the surface of several icy moons ejecting water vapor due to tidal heating and may indicate the presence of substantial quantities of subsurface water.\nPlumes of water vapor have been detected on Jupiter's moon Europa and are similar to plumes of water vapor detected on Saturn's moon Enceladus.\n[45] Traces of water vapor have also been detected in the stratosphere of Titan.\n[47] Water vapor has been found to be a major constituent of the atmosphere of dwarf planet, Ceres, largest object in the asteroid belt  [48] The detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of the Herschel Space Observatory.\n[49] The finding is unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to \"sprout jets and plumes.\"\nAccording to one of the scientists, \"The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids.\"\n[49] Scientists studying Mars hypothesize that if water moves about the planet, it does so as vapor.\n[50]The brilliance of comet tails comes largely from water vapor.\nOn approach to the Sun, the ice many comets carry sublimates to vapor, which reflects light from the Sun.\nKnowing a comet's distance from the sun, astronomers may deduce a comet's water content from its brilliance.\n[51]Water vapor has also been confirmed outside the Solar System.\nSpectroscopic analysis of HD 209458 b, an extrasolar planet in the constellation Pegasus, provides the first evidence of atmospheric water vapor beyond the Solar System.\nA star called CW Leonis was found to have a ring of vast quantities of water vapor circling the aging, massive star.\nA NASA satellite designed to study chemicals in interstellar gas clouds, made the discovery with an onboard spectrometer.\nMost likely, \"the water vapor was vaporized from the surfaces of orbiting comets.\"\n[52] HAT-P-11b a relatively small exoplanet has also been found to possess water vapour.\n[53]See also  [ edit]Wikimedia Commons has media related to Water vapor.\nAir density\nBoiling

    "document": "Aloft Hotels Aloft Hotels\nType Franchise\nIndustry hospitality\nFounded 2005Founder W Hotels\nNumber of locations 100 hotels\nArea served United States, Canada, Europe, Asia\nOwner Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide  (through subsidiary W Hotels)Parent Marriott International\nWebsite www .starwoodhotels .com /alofthotels\nAloft Hotels is a hotel chain based in North America, owned by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide  (which was acquired by Marriott International in October 2016), although it is referred to as \"a vision of W Hotels \".\nThe first hotel opened at the Trudeau International Airport in Montreal in 2008.\n[1] Aloft Hotels have since opened across North America and internationally.\nMost Aloft hotels are located in city centers or in close proximity to airports.\nThe brand is most notable for its modern architecture design style.\n[1] Another characteristic of Aloft hotels is the naming of basic hotel amenities.\nFor example, in each hotel, the swimming pool is referred to as \"splash\".\n[2]Contents [ hide ]1 History2 Hotels2.1 Local connections2.2 Environmental impact3 Locations4 Reception5 References\nHistory  [ edit]Aloft Hotels was conceived in 2005 by Starwood Hotels.\nThe hotel chain already had many brands, including Sheraton, Westin, and W Hotels, but was looking to expand into a market of more contemporary hotels, which would eventually become known as boutique hotels.\nTo reflect its relationship with Starwood Hotels, the Aloft brand was dubbed as \"A Vision of W Hotels\".\nStarwood worked with the architectural company Rockwell Group and its founder David Rockwell to come up with the design.\n[1]To generate interest in the brand before its 2008 opening, Starwood launched a virtual tour of the hotels using Second Life,  [3] whose site allows visitors to move through a typical Aloft Hotel and explore its aspects in detail.\nStarwood monitored statistics from the site, gauged public reception based upon visitors' opinions, and incorporated this information into the design of future Aloft Hotels.\n[3]Hotels  [ edit]Local connections  [ edit]Aloft Hotels emphasize the local community, such as by highlighting local musicians at the w xyz bar, and holding Facebook contests to find the best local musicians.\n[4]Environmental impact  [ edit]Aloft Hotels strive for a lowered environmental impact.\nAn example is the Aloft Milwaukee Downtown, where outdoor landscaping was done to try to give a fresh, green image on the outside of the hotel.\n[2] On the inside, engineers used natural wood treatments and materials such as cork to reduce negative effects on the environment.\n[2] Guest rooms have soap dispensers in the shower instead of bottles, and the option to keep towels for multiple uses.\n[2] Parking spots are designated specifically for hybrid vehicles, encouraging guests to make environmentally responsible choices.\n[5]Locations  [ edit]Since its first hotel opened in 2008, the Aloft brand has grown rapidly.\nThe hotel originally started in North America and expanded to include international locations.\nAccording to the Aloft website, in the United States there are current locations in 27 states.\nThere are also open locations in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, England, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Uruguay.\n[2]In 2011 and 2012, 20 proposed locations were to open, including in Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, and England,  [2] for a total of 66 Aloft locations.\nWhile positive for the hotel brand, this number was well short of an original anticipation to have 500 locations by 2012.\n[3]In early 2013, the brand opened a 482-room property in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, making it the largest Aloft hotel in the world.\nThe hotel includes a ballroom that can accommodate up to 1,000 people in a theatre setting.\n[6]In 2013, the chain opened a new hotel at the Ernst & Young Tower in Cleveland, Ohio.\n[7]In September 2016, Aloft entered the Saudi Arabian market with a new hotel near the center of Riyadh.\n[8]In December 2016, Aloft Long Island City-Manhattan View opened.\n[9]In 2017 and 2018 Aloft is slated to open properties in Kiev, Ukraine and St. Petersburg, Russia, respectively.\nAloft Hotels has opened some locations in areas that have shown low growth in recent times, helping to revitalize struggling urban areas.\nFor instance, the Aloft location opened in downtown Milwaukee in December 2009 was the first new hotel built in Milwaukee since 2001.\n[10] The hotel opened in Harlem, New York in December 2010 was the first hotel opened there in 40 years.\n[11] The first Aloft hotel opened in the Perth suburb of Rivervale on May 26, 2017.\n[12]Reception  [ edit]Public reception of Aloft Hotels has been mixed.\nThe majority of opinions revolve around the two main aspects of the hotel brand: room prices, and the contemporary style.\nThe trademark culture of Aloft Hotels has also drawn some criticism.\nThe contemporary theme of Aloft Hotels is not appreciated by everyone, and some critics feel the Aloft Hotels have too much of a \"cookie cutter\" feel to them.\n[10] In addition, the barrage of colors, shapes, and lingo from the first moment in the hotel has been noted as simply too much for some to handle.\n[10]References  [ edit]^ a b c aloft Montreal Airport Opens, Making Global Lifestyle Debut.\nBusiness\nWire.com, June 5, 2008, Accessed November 8, 2010.^ a b c d e f

    "document": "4 Effective Ways Essiac Tea Can Help Treat Cancer Essiac tea has been the subject of both controversy and excitement in regards to its effects on cancer.\nThe various components of essiac tea are known to stimulate the immune system, reduce free radical activity, eliminate inflammation, prevent tumor growth, reduce cellular mutation, detoxify the body and soothe pulmonary afflictions.\nSide effects of essiac tea include nausea, vomiting, headaches, frequent urination, skin irritation, muscle aches, weakness and other allergic reactions.\nBefore taking essiac tea, it is important to ensure that you are not allergic to any of the four primary components.\nThe origins of essiac tea stretch back thousands of years to the indigenous people of Canada, but it was first used in the 1920s by a nurse named Rene Caisse, who administered it to many of her cancer patients with very promising results.\nAfter attempting to introduce it to the mainstream in the rest of North America, there was a great deal of pushback from the medical establishment, and it remains an unregulated treatment, despite hundreds of positive anecdotal reports [ 1].\nEssiac tea is composed of sheep sorrel, burdock root, Indian rhubarb root and the inner bark of the slippery elm.\nEach of these ingredients contribute different health benefits and active ingredients, such as flavones, tannins and anthraquinones, as well as polysaccharides that further boost the immune system.\nEssiac Tea & Cancer Treatment\nIn the treatment and prevention of cancer, essiac tea is particularly effective when cancer is discovered early, although it can be a supportive remedy if the cancer has already progressed.\nEach of the ingredients provides different nutrients and benefits that synergistically attack cancer cells and strengthen the body's defenses.\nModern medicine hesitates to call essiac tea a \"cure\" for cancer, but it does show positive effects against tumor growth, cancer cell reproduction, oxidative stress and tissue inflammation, while also tackling certain secondary symptoms of cancer that can exacerbate or speed the condition.\nTo understand the effect of essiac tea on cancer, individually examining the four ingredients is essential.\nSheep Sorrel\nThis herb, taxonomically known as Rumex acetosella, is a rich source of beta-carotene [ 2], vitamin A, vitamin C and other carotenoids; in fact, it is widely praised as one of the most antioxidant-dense herbs available to natural healers.\nStudies on sheep sorrel have found that it does have anti-proliferative effects on cancerous cells, meaning that it can prevent the replication and metastasis of cancerous growths.\nFurthermore, it is well known as a blood purifier, further cleansing the areas of infection.\nRene Caisse claimed that this ingredient was the most powerful cancer-fighting element in essiac tea.\nBurdock Root\nThis element of essiac tea contains anthraquinone, a chemical that is well known to slow tumor growth and prevent cellular mutation, which is what leads to cancer.\nIn fact, anthraquinone is found in a number of mainstream cancer drugs due to its powerful anti-mutagenic effects.\nOther studies have found that burdock root extract have apoptotic effects on cancerous cells, meaning that it stimulates cell death in those malignant cells, without harming healthy cells around it.\nIndian Rhubarb Root\nAlthough not as strong of an anti-cancer ingredient as the first two components, indian rhubarb root [ 4] has proven anti-inflammatory qualities and can protect pulmonary function, particularly in people suffering from or at risk of lung cancer, as well as those receiving radiation therapy for certain cancer types.\nSlippery Elm (Inner Bark)This herbal ingredient contains plant sterols, tannins and essential fatty acids that can reduce inflammation [ 5], as well as mucilage and calcium oxalate, which helps this herb detoxify the body.\nIn combination with the other elements of essiac tea, slippery elm protects the health of organs from the effects of mainstream cancer treatments, while simultaneously supporting the immune system.\nEssiac Tea Other Benefits\nThe role of essiac tea in cancer prevention and treatment gets most of the attention, but essiac tea can also help to relieve inflammation throughout the body, boost the immune system, treat respiratory conditions, stimulate the metabolism, promotes normal digestion and heals skin conditions.\nInflammation: Antioxidant compounds found in sheep sorrel and burdock root also have anti-inflammatory properties that can help people suffering from arthritis, headaches, gout, heart disease, joint disorders, muscle aches, hemorrhoids and a range of other common inflammatory issues [ 6].\nDigestion: The mucilage found in slippery elm is able to promote digestive efficiency and eliminate symptoms of constipation and bloating.\nSimilarly, sheep sorrel is a laxative, which can speed up the digestive process and flush out the digestive tract, which can often eliminate harmful bacteria that have set up residence in the gut.\nMetabolism: This unique blend of herbs has a stimulating effect on the body, which results in better metabolic function and even passive fat-burning, which is good for hormone and enzyme production, as well as weight- loss efforts.\nImmune System: Studies have shown that the combined antioxidant effects of essiac tea's ingredients is greater than that of green tea, meaning that these herbs can give a major boost to the immune system.\nOutside of preventing cancer, it can also stimulate white blood cell production and defend against bacterial and viral infections.\nRespiratory Issues: Slippery elm and Indian rhubarb root, in particular, are known to soothe respiratory infections and cut through phlegm and mucus.\nThese expectorant properties can speed healing and lower inflammation in the respiratory tracts.\nEssiac Tea Ingredients\nThe classic recipe for essiac tea includes sheep sorrel, burdock root, Indian rhubarb root and slippery elm bark.\nHowever, there have been a number of variations on this original formula in recent decades.\nThe most popular \"improvement\" on Rene Caisse's formula is called Flor Essence and adds four additional herbs to the mix \u2013 watercress, blessed thistle, red clover and kelp.\nThese additional components are able to complement and improve the anti-cancer effects of this impressive health tonic.\nAlso see\nBurdock Root Tea- Benefits, How to Make, & Side Effects 11 Amazing Benefits of Slippery Elm\nSide Effects of Essiac Tea\nSome of the side effects of essiac tea include nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, dehydration, excessive urination and bowel movements and flu-like symptoms.\nThese negative side effects are primarily due to the active ingredients in burdock root and sheep sorrel, or if users are allergic to the herbal ingredients.\nLaxative and Diuretic \u2013 Burdock root is well known as a diuretic substance [ 8], which can help to detoxify the body, but might also lead to dehydration if the urination becomes too frequent or constant.\nSheep sorrel, on the other hand, is a laxative substance, and when essiac tea is taken in large quantities, it can lead to diarrhea, nausea and other stomach upset.\nAllergic Reactions \u2013 All four of the herbs commonly included in essiac tea are potential allergens, especially burdock root, which is closely related [ 9] to ragweed and daisies \u2013 common allergenic substances.\nMost of the side effects in the case of an allergic reaction are skin irritation, mild stomach upset and swelling of the tongue, lips and glands.\n\n",

    "document": "Ductility From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search\nFor ductility in Earth science, see Ductility (Earth science).\n\"Malleability\" redirects here.\nFor the property in cryptography, see Malleability (cryptography).\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.\nPlease help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources.\nUnsourced material may be challenged and removed.\n(October 2008)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Tensile test of an Al\nMg\nSi alloy.\nThe local necking and the cup and cone fracture surfaces are typical for ductile metals.\nThis tensile test of a nodular cast iron demonstrates low ductility.\nDuctility is a measure of a material's ability to undergo significant plastic deformation before rupture, which may be expressed as percent elongation or percent area reduction from a tensile test.\nAccording to Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design--10th Ed.\n[1] significant denotes about 5.0 percent elongation (Section 5.3, p. 233).\nSee also Eq.\n2-12, p. 50 for definitions of percent elongation and percent area reduction.\nDuctility is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire.\nFrom examination of data in Tables A20, A21, A22, A23, and A24 in Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design--10th Edition  [1] for both ductile and brittle materials, it is possible to postulate a broader quantifiable definition of ductility that does not rely on percent elongation alone.\nIn general, a ductile material must have a measurable yield strength, at which unrecoverable plastic deformation begins (see Yield_ (engineering) ), and also must satisfy one of the following conditions: either have an elongation to failure of at least 5%, and/or area reduction to rupture at least 20%, and/or true strain to rupture at least 10%.\nMalleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling.\nBoth of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture.\nAlso, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures).\nDuctility and malleability are not always coextensive \u2013 for instance, while gold has high ductility and malleability, lead has low ductility but high malleability.\n[2] The word ductility is sometimes used to encompass both types of plasticity.\n[3]Contents [ hide ]1 Materials science2 Ductile\u2013brittle transition temperature3 See also4 References5 External links\nMaterials science  [ edit]Gold is extremely ductile.\nIt can be drawn into a monatomic wire, and then stretched about twice before it breaks.\n[4]Ductility is especially important in metalworking, as materials that crack, break or shatter under stress cannot be manipulated using metal-forming processes such as hammering, rolling, and drawing.\nMalleable materials can be formed cold using stamping or pressing, whereas brittle materials may be cast or thermoformed.\nHigh degrees of ductility occur due to metallic bonds, which are found predominantly in metals, leading to the common perception that metals are ductile in general.\nIn metallic bonds valence shell electrons are delocalized and shared between many atoms.\nThe delocalized electrons allow metal atoms to slide past one another without being subjected to strong repulsive forces that would cause other materials to shatter.\nDuctility can be quantified by the fracture strain, which is the engineering strain at which a test specimen fractures during a uniaxial tensile test.\nAnother commonly used measure is the reduction of area at fracture.\n[5] The ductility of steel varies depending on the alloying constituents.\nIncreasing the levels of carbon decreases ductility.\nMany plastics and amorphous solids, such as Play-Doh, are also malleable.\nThe most ductile metal is platinum and the most malleable metal is gold.\n[6]  [7]Ductile\u2013brittle transition temperature  [ edit]Schematic appearance of round metal bars after tensile testing.\n(a) Brittle fracture  (b) Ductile fracture  (c) Completely ductile fracture\nThe ductile\u2013brittle transition temperature (DBTT), nil ductility temperature (NDT), or nil ductility transition temperature of a metal is the temperature at which the fracture energy passes below a predetermined value (for steels typically 40 J  [8] for a standard Charpy impact test ).\nDBTT is important since, once a material is cooled below the DBTT, it has a much greater tendency to shatter on impact instead of bending or deforming.\nFor example, zamak 3 exhibits good ductility at room temperature but shatters when impacted at sub-zero temperatures.\nDBTT is a very important consideration in selecting materials that are subjected to mechanical stresses.\nA similar phenomenon, the glass transition temperature, occurs with glasses and polymers, although the mechanism is different in these amorphous materials.\nIn some materials, the transition is sharper than others and typically requires a temperature-sensitive deformation mechanism.\nFor example, in materials with a body-centered cubic  (bcc) lattice the DBTT is readily apparent, as the motion of screw dislocations is very temperature sensitive because the rearrangement of the dislocation core prior to slip requires thermal activation.\nThis can be problematic for steels with a high ferrite content.\nThis famously resulted in serious hull cracking in Liberty ships in colder waters during World War II, causing many sinkings.\nDBTT can also be influenced by external factors such as neutron radiation, which leads to an increase in internal lattice defects and a corresponding decrease in ductility and increase in DBTT.\nThe most accurate method of measuring the DBTT of a material is by fracture testing.\nTypically four point bend testing at a range of temperatures is performed on pre-cracked bars of polished material.\nFor experiments conducted at higher temperatures, dislocation activity increases.\nAt a certain temperature, dislocations shield the crack tip to such an extent that the applied deformation rate is not sufficient for the stress intensity at the crack-tip to reach the critical value for fracture (K i\nC ).\nThe temperature at which this occurs is the ductile\u2013brittle transition temperature.\nIf experiments are performed at a higher strain rate, more dislocation shielding is required to prevent brittle fracture, and the transition temperature is raised.\nSee also  [ edit]Deformation\nWork hardening, which improves ductility in uniaxial tension by delaying the onset of instability\nStrength of materials\nReferences  [ edit]^ a b Budynas, Richard G.

\"\nfor more strategies.)\nIndeed, there is an increased risk of fungal and bacterial eye infections among contact lens wearers in general, and proper contact lens care must be followed.\nFDA guidelines recommend that manufacturers include a discard date (not just a date of expiration) on contact lens cleaning and disinfecting products to help minimize the risk of eye infection.\nTrachoma.\nWhile uncommon in the United States, an eye infection known as trachoma, related to Chlamydia trachomatis, is so widespread in certain under-developed regions that it is a leading cause of blindness.\nFlies can spread the infection in unsanitary environments, and reinfection is a common problem.\nTrachoma typically infects the inner eyelid, which begins to scar.\nScarring then causes an \"in-turning\" of the eyelid, and eyelashes begin to brush against and destroy tissue on the cornea, with resulting permanent blindness.\nGood hygiene and availability of treatments such as oral antibiotics are essential to controlling trachoma.\nEndophthalmitis.\nWhen an eye infection penetrates the eye's interior, as with bacterial endophthalmitis, blindness could result without immediate treatment, often with potent antibiotics.\nThis type of infection can occur with a penetrating eye injury or as a rare complication of eye surgery such as cataract surgery.\nAny time the eye's globe is penetrated and injured significantly, there is a 4 to 8 percent risk of endophthalmitis.\n* Mold that penetrates the eye's interior also can cause endophthalmitis, though rarely, with most cases reported in tropical regions.\nReporting Eye Infections\nHad A Bad Reaction To Eye Makeup?\nThe FDA Wants To Hear From You\nIn this video, the U.\nS. Food and Drug Administration urges you to report any problems you may have with a cosmetic.\nProblems may include a bad reaction, such as a rash, hair loss or eye infection.\nYou should also report a bad smell or unusual color (which could mean that the product is old or contaminated), as well as inaccurate or incomplete labeling.\nWatch the brief video to get a phone number and website address where you can make your report.\nEye Infection Complications\nAn infection also can affect interior portions of the upper and lower eyelids to create a stye or chalazion.\nWhen infection invades the eye's tear glands, inflammatory conditions such as dacryostenosis and uveitis can result.\nInfection also can lead to inflammation and blockage of the eye's tear drainage system and cause dacryocystitis.\nInfection can be an underlying cause of a corneal ulcer, which resembles an abscess on the eye.\nIf left untreated, a corneal ulcer can lead to severe vision loss.\nMore serious eye infections can penetrate the deeper, interior portions of the eye to create sight-threatening conditions such as endophthalmitis.\nWith orbital cellulitis, infection found in and around the soft tissue of the eyelids represents an emergency because the condition can spread if left untreated.\nEye Infection Treatments\nFortunately, most common bacterial eye infections clear up, particularly with prompt treatment such as prescription antibiotic eye drops or ointments and compresses.\nMany common viral eye infections resolve on their own.\nIn cases of severe viral eye infections, an antiviral eye drop may be prescribed.\nSome viral eye infections require careful administration of steroid eye drops to reduce related inflammation.\nDepending on the underlying cause of your eye infection, your doctor also may prescribe antibiotics or antiviral medications that are taken orally.\nIf your symptoms worsen or change, contact your eye doctor immediately.\nHow To Prevent Eye Infections\nIf you are near a person with a red eye, avoid contact around your own eye until you wash your hands first.\nYou can minimize the likelihood of catching common bacterial or viral eye infections by using anti-infective sprays and cleansers liberally in public areas such as day care centers and classrooms.\nPrevent eye infections by washing your hands before touching your eyes or eyelids and before handling contact lenses.\nAt home, if any family members have a red eye or a confirmed eye infection, keep their bedding and towels clean, and don't let them share these items with anyone else.\nHave them wash their hands often.\nAnd in general, teach children to avoid touching their eyes without washing their hands first.\nIf you are a contact lens wearer, you should follow safety tips for good hygiene, such as hand washing before you handle your contacts.\nAlso, be aware that sleeping while wearing contact lenses, even if you wear the new \"breathable\" silicone hydrogel contact lenses that are FDA-approved for overnight wear, significantly increases your risk of eye infection.\nBack to top \u2934Home \u00bb Conditions \u00bb Eye Infections | En Espa\u00f1ol\nReferences & Notes >>Marilyn Haddrill also contributed to this article.\n[Page updated February 12, 2018]Like This Page?\nPlease Share!\n\n",

    "document": "School Years around the World From Australia to South Koreaby Mark Hughes\nRelated Links\nBack to School Center\nWorld Atlas\nEducation\nSomewhere in the world, right now, students are hard at work in school.\nWith over 190 nations spanning the globe's 24 time zones, students and their academic years come in a variety of forms.\nHere's a sampling of the typical school year in 13 nations throughout the world.\nAustralia\nStudents in Australia attend school for 200 days a year.\nTheir school year lasts from late January to mid December.\nSince Australia is in the southern hemisphere, it experiences summer while it's winter in the northern hemisphere.\nSummer vacation for Australian students is from mid December to late January.\nTheir school year is divided into four terms, with each term lasting 9 to 11 weeks.\nStudents then have two weeks of vacation between each term.\nThe typical school day is from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., and lunch is eaten at school.\nStudents are required to attend school for at least eleven years, but they usually attend for twelve years.\nThe average class size is eighteen students and there are about six computers per classroom.\nSchool grades in Australia are called years.\nKindergarten is the first year of formal schooling, followed by year 1 through year 6; secondary school is from year 7 to year 12.\nA 6 year old begins in year one, while an 18 year old finishes school by year 12.\nFrom year one to year six, students spend about 12 hours a week working on math and English.\nMany schools integrate subjects, meaning they combine two or more academic subjects.\nFor instance, say your class is studying coral reefs.\nA non-integrated approach would have students study coral reels only in science class.\nAn integrated method incorporates math, by taking measurements, for example, and language arts.\nStudents would then use that information to write a report about coral reefs.\nBrazil\nBrazil, also found in the southern hemisphere, shares the same summer months as Australia.\nThe school day in Brazil runs from 7 a.m. to noon, and students typically go home at noon to share lunch with their family.\nLunch is the most important meal of the day.\nMost schools require students to wear a uniform.\nMath, geography, history, science, Portuguese, which is the national language of Brazil, and physical education are the main subjects studied by students in Brazil.\nMany schools can barely afford to teach those subjects, which means that courses like art and music are often left out in poorer areas.\nThe average class size is 30 or more students.\nMost schools do not have a computer in the classrooms, or have only one or two computers for 30 students to share.\nChina\nBecause China is in the northern hemisphere, its summer months are in line with Asia, Europe, and North America.\nThe school year in China typically runs from the beginning of September to mid-July.\nSummer vacation is generally spent in summer classes or studying for entrance exams.\nThe average school day runs from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a two-hour lunch break.\nFormal education in China lasts for nine years.\nChina provides all students with uniforms, but does not require they be worn.\nThere are about 21 students in each classroom.\nAll Chinese students study from textbooks that emphasize China's unity, past and present accomplishments, and its future.\nStudents in China also have great access to computer technology, with a computer to student ratio of 1:2.\nChinese language and math skills are tested at the end of each year.\nMath is typically taught by drill, which means students are repeatedly taught the basics of math until they are able to demonstrate comprehension.\nEducation in China since the turn of the 21st century has been undergoing reform, with curriculum being redesigned to emphasize group activities and other methods believed to foster creativity and innovation.\nCosta Rica\nCosta Rica was one of the first nations in Central and South America to offer free public education.\nOn average, there are about twenty-eight students in a classroom.\nStudents are required to wear uniforms during the nine years of their formal education, from ages 6 to 15, and supply their own lunches and snacks.\nStudents then begin college at age 15.\nThe school year in Costa Rica runs from February to December.\nStudents have vacation for about two months, from December to February, and a few weeks off in July.\nCosta Rica is one of the most literate nations in Central America with over 96% of students over age 15 being able to read.\nIn addition to the regular subjects\u2013Spanish, social studies, math, and science\u2013all Costa Rican schools now teach students English and computer science.\nFrance\nThe school day in France typically runs from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a half day on Saturday, although students do not attend school on Wednesday or Sunday.\nLunch is a two-hour break for public school students.\nStudents usually attend school from ages 6 to 18.\nThe average number of students per class is 23.\nUniforms are not required, but religious dress of any kind is banned.\nThe school year for this country in the northern hemisphere stretches from August to June, and is divided into four seven-week terms, with one to two weeks of vacation in between.\nStudents in the primary grades, from age's 6 to 11, learn basic skills in reading, writing, and math, as well as participate in exercises to develop observation, reasoning, imagination, and physical abilities.\nOlder students study French, math, physical and natural sciences, foreign language, history and geography, economics, and civics.\nIran\nIran is another nation in the northern hemisphere with a school year similar to European countries.\nStudents in Iran go to school for 10 months a year, or about 200 active days, from September to June.\nThe average number of students per classroom is 27.\nFrom ages 5 to 18, boys and girls are educated separately.\nGirls typically have female teachers, while boys are taught by men.\nReligious study in Iran is required.\nMen and women do study together at the university level\u2013by 2006, over half of all university students in Iran were women.\nBeginning at age 5, all students must pass a yearly exam in order to move to the next grade level.\nStudents in primary school learn about hygiene, basic math and science, reading, and study skills.\nBecause many schools are in remote areas or do not have the money for such things as libraries, resourcefulness is necessary.\nFor example, mobile libraries trundle across Iran to bring books to more than 4,000 children in 40 different schools.\nEach bus has two librarians and around 3,000 books.\nStudents tend to get very excited when they hear the engine of the library bus coming their way.\nJapan\nMost Japanese schools run on a trimester schedule.\nThe academic year begins in April and ends the following March, with breaks for summer, winter and spring separating the three terms.\nUniforms are required and there are extensive rules for hair styles, shoes, socks, skirt length, make-up, accessories, and more.\nIn each classroom, the average number of students is 29 with five or six computers to share between them.\nStudents in Japan study academic subjects, such as Japanese language, math, reading, social studies, music, and art, and they also receive moral education.\nMoral education involves teaching students about health and safety, living a disciplined life, courtesy, understanding and confidence, public manners, and environmental awareness.\nKenya\nThe school year in this southern-hemisphere nation is divided into three terms, each 13 weeks long, with one-month breaks in between.\nSchool days are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nUniforms are mandatory in government-run schools.\nMost classrooms have about thirty students in them.\nMany schools provide lunch.\nBecause Kenya is experiencing severe economic and environmental hardships, some students save all or part of their lunch to share with their families.\nStudents study the Kiswahili language, English, math, science, music, history, civics, and geography, and receive religious instruction.\nMexico\nThe school year in Mexico runs from September to June.\nStudents go to school Monday through Friday, and have elective classes on Saturdays.\nStudents are required to wear uniforms for primaria  (elementary school) and secondaria  (middle school).\nSchool days are divided into two sessions, one for the morning and one for the afternoon.\nIn each classroom, there are about 30 students who must share three computers.\nStudents learn Spanish, math, art, and physical education.\nOther subjects are integrated into courses called environmental knowledge.\nThese include the natural sciences, history, geography, civics, reading, writing, and oral expression.\nNigeria\nThe school year in Nigeria runs from January to December.\nThe year is divided into three semesters with a month off in between each semester.\nStudents must wear uniforms, as well as obey rules for hair, jewelry, and accessory restrictions.\nThere are about 40 students in each classroom in Nigeria.\nThere they will learn one of the three main languages (Hausa, Yoruba, or Ibo), math, English, social studies, health and physical education, religious instruction, agriculture, and home economics.\nNorth Korea\nStudents in North Korea must attend school for 11 years, beginning at age 5.\nStudents must wear uniforms provided by the government, and many students receive room and board from their government.\nStudents study music, art, math, the Korean language, social education.\nSocial education includes studying about the former leader Kim Il Song, and \"Communist Morality.\" In later years they learn about the policies of the communist party.\nSocial education also provides students with a controlled environment in which to learn so they are protected from \"bad or unplanned influences.\"Russia\nThe school year in Russia runs from the first of September to late May.\nStudents attend class from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. No uniforms are required; students are instead encouraged to dress warmly.\nStudents remain together in the same class from grades one to ten.\nEach classroom has about 16 students.\nTenth grade is the last year of mandatory education.\nEleventh and 12th grades offer optional paths, either to vocational schools to learn trade skills or to continue to study for university entrance exams.\nStudents in grades one to ten study Russian, math, reading, natural sciences, music, art, and physical education.\nSouth Korea\nThe school year in South Korea typically runs from March to February.\nThe year is divided into two semesters (March to July and September to February).\nSchool days are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but many stay later into the evening.\nIn addition, students help clean up their classroom before leaving.\nMost students remain in the same room while their teachers rotate throughout the day.\nEach room has about thirty students with ten computers for them to share.\nAfter 5 p.m. students have a short dinner at home, or eat at school, before study sessions or other activities begin in the evening.\nStudents attend school Monday to Friday, with some Saturday classes scattered throughout the year.\nTheir classes cover the Korean language, math, science, physical education, social studies, moral education, music, fine and practical arts.\nIn third grade students begin receiving English instruction for two hours a week.\nMore from World Stats and Facts\nDid you know?\nFor more than a billion Muslims around the world, Ramadan is a \"month of blessing\" marked by prayer, fasting, and charity.\n\n",

    "document": "How to Weld Aluminum With a Stick Welder Home \u00bbHobbies\nHow to Weld Aluminum With a Stick Welder\nBy Derek Odom; Updated April 12, 2017The first thing necessary for stick welding on aluminum is to have a machine capable of DC (direct current) polarity, and it must be capable of putting out at least 200 amps.\nIf your welder meets these guidelines, you are in business.\nIf you have a 120-volt, 140-amp machine, for instance, there is no way it will ever weld on aluminum.\nVoltage and amperage are the key.\nSet the current on the machine.\nYou will need a welder capable of at least 200 amps to successfully weld aluminum materials.\nSet the machine to between 190 and 210 amps, depending on the thickness of the material to weld.\nUnfortunately because of the deep penetration that stick welding aluminum creates, it is only recommended for quarter-inch and thicker material in most cases.\nWatch the length of your arc.\nGenerally, when stick welding aluminum, the arc length should be about the same as the diameter of the aluminum rod.\nHolding the rod too close to the aluminum decreases the voltage and compromises penetration.\nHolding the rod too far away increases the voltage but will cause porosity in the weld as well as lots of spatter.\nWith a little practice, keeping the arc at a steady distance from the work becomes second nature.\nAngle the rod at about 15 degrees against the aluminum being welded.\nIf the rod is held straight up and down, it may not produce a clean arc, and the weld will be compromised.\nHolding it at 25 degrees or more will result in poor penetration and cause the weld to be weak.\nDrag the rod away from the weld rather than pushing into the weld as one might do with an MIG wire feed setup.\nDevelop a weld style and stick with it.\nSome people like to weld in a straight bee-line, which will produce a fine weld in most cases.\nOthers like to make little \"C\" traveling arcs with the welding rod, which will create a weld that resembles a stack of dimes.\nAnother technique is to zig-zag the rod back and forth across the gap, pausing for a second at each side before continuing diagonally over to the other side.\nAll these styles work equally well, and it is purely a matter of taste which you choose for your own stick welding.\nJust remember to travel slowly to ensure a good puddle and nice penetration.\nAluminum cools and dissipates heat very quickly, which is why it needs more amps.\nTherefore moving the rod as slowly as possible will keep the alloy heated well enough to weld.\nThings Needed\nDC polarity welder capable of 200 amps\nAluminum and aluminum rod\nWarning\nNever weld without a protective hood and gloves.\nReferences\"Welder's Handbook, Revised\nHP1513: A Guide to Plasma Cutting, Oxyacetylene, ARC, MIG and TIG Welding;\" Richard Finch; 2007About the Author\nDerek Odom has freelanced since 2008 and is also an author of the macabre.\nHe has been published on Ches.com, Planetchess.com and various other websites.\nOdom has an Associate of Arts in administration of justice.\n\n",

what is ?\n)Infobox references\nTartrazine is a synthetic lemon yellow azo dye primarily used as a food coloring.\n[1]  [2]  [3]  [4] It is also known as E number E102, C.\nI.\n19140, FD&C Yellow 5, Acid Yellow 23, Food Yellow 4, and trisodium 1- (4-sulfonatophenyl)-4- (4-sulfonatophenylazo)-5-pyrazolone-3-carboxylate).\n[5]Tartrazine is a commonly used color all over the world, mainly for yellow, and can also be used with Brilliant Blue FCF  (FD&C Blue 1, E133) or Green S  (E142) to produce various green shades.\nContents [ hide ]1 Products containing tartrazine1.1 Foods1.2 Personal care and cosmetics products1.3 Medications1.4 Other products2 Chemistry3 Potential health effects on humans3.1 Sensitivity3.2 Asthma4 Regulation4.1 Canada4.2 United Kingdom and EU4.3 United States5 Alternative coloring agents6 Myths7 References8 External links\nProducts containing tartrazine  [ edit]Foods  [ edit]Many foods contain tartrazine in varying proportions, depending on the manufacturer or person preparing the food, although the recent trend is to avoid it or substitute a non-synthetic dyeing substance such as annatto, malt color, or beta carotene  [ citation needed]  (see Sensitivities and intolerance, below).\nWhen in food, tartrazine is typically labelled as \"color\", \"tartrazine\", or \"E102\", depending on the jurisdiction, and the applicable labeling laws (see Regulation below).\nProducts containing tartrazine commonly include processed commercial foods that have an artificial yellow or green color, or that consumers expect to be brown or creamy looking.\nIt has been frequently used in the bright yellow coloring of imitation \"lemon\" filling in baked goods.\nThe following is a list of foods that may contain tartrazine:\nDesserts and confectionary: ice cream, ice pops and popsicles, confectionery and hard candy  (such as gummy bears, Peeps marshmallow treats, etc.\n), cotton candy, instant puddings and gelatin (such as Jell-O ), cake mixes, pastries  (such as Pillsbury pastries), custard powder, marzipan, biscuits, and cookies.\nBeverages: soft drinks  (such as Mountain Dew ), energy and sports drinks, powdered drink mixes  (such as Kool-Aid ), fruit cordials, and flavored/mixed alcoholic beverages.\nSnacks: flavored corn chips  (such as Doritos, nachos, etc.\n), chewing gum, popcorn  (both microwave and cinema-popped), and potato chips.\nCondiments and spreads: jam, jelly  (including mint jelly ), marmalade, mustard, horseradish, pickles  (and other products containing pickles such as tartar sauce and dill pickle dip), and processed sauces.\nOther processed foods: cereal  (such as corn flakes, muesli, etc.\n), instant or \"cube\" soups ), rices  (like paella, risotto, etc.\n), noodles  (such as some varieties of Kraft Dinner ), pureed fruit and pickled peppers, bright-green-colored seaweed salad.\nPersonal care and cosmetics products  [ edit]A number of personal care and cosmetics products may contain tartrazine, usually labelled as CI 19140 or FD&C Yellow 5, including:\nLiquid and bar soaps, green hand sanitizer, moisturizers and lotions, mouth washes, perfumes, toothpastes, and shampoos, conditioners and other hair products.\nCosmetics, such as eyeshadow, blush, face powder and foundation, lipstick, etc.\n- even those that are primarily pink or purple.\n(Usually make-up manufacturers use one label for all shades in a product line, placing the phrase \"may contain\" ahead of all colors that are used in that line, not necessarily that specific shade.\n)Nail polish, nail polish remover, temporary tattoos, and tanning lotions.\nMedications  [ edit]Various types of medications include tartrazine to give a yellow, orange or green hue to a liquid, capsule, pill, lotion, or gel, primarily for easy identification.\n[6] Types of pharmaceutical products that may contain tartrazine include vitamins, antacids, cold medications (including cough drops and throat lozenges ), lotions and prescription drugs.\nMost, if not all, medication data sheets are required to contain a list of all ingredients, including tartrazine.\nSome include tartrazine in the allergens alert section.\nThe Canadian Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties  (CPS), a prescribing reference book for health professionals, mentions tartrazine as a potential allergy for each drug that contains tartrazine.\nOther products  [ edit]Other products, such as household cleaning products, paper plates, pet foods, crayons, inks for writing instruments, stamp dyes, face paints and envelope glues, may also contain tartrazine.\nChemistry  [ edit]Tartrazine is water-soluble  [7] and has a maximum absorbance in an aqueous solution at 425 nm.\n[8]Like many azo dyes tartrazine is manufactured using petrochemicals as starting stock, and was formerly manufactured using chemicals derived from coal tar as the starting material.\n[9]Potential health effects on humans  [ edit]Sensitivity  [ edit]Tartrazine appears to cause the most allergic and intolerance reactions of all the azo dyes, particularly among asthmatics and those with an aspirin intolerance.\n[10] Symptoms from tartrazine sensitivity can occur by either ingestion or cutaneous exposure to a substance containing tartrazine.\nSymptoms appear after periods of time ranging from minutes up to 14 hours.\n[11]The prevalence of tartrazine intolerance is estimated at roughly 360,000 U.\nS. Citizens affected, less than 0.12% of the general population.\n[12] According to the FDA, tartrazine causes hives in fewer than 1 in 10,000 people, or 0.01%.\n[13]It is not clear how many individuals are sensitive or intolerant to tartrazine, but the University of Guelph estimates that it is 1 to 10 out of every ten thousand people (0.01% to 0.1% of the population).\n[14] There is much controversy about whether tartrazine has ill effects on individuals who are not clearly intolerant.\nTotal avoidance is the most common way to deal with tartrazine sensitivity,  [15] but progress has been made in reducing people's tartrazine sensitivity in a study of people who are simultaneously sensitive to both aspirin and tartrazine.\n[16]Asthma  [ edit]A systematic review of the medical literature concluded that among patients with asthma, research has shown that exposure to tartrazine does not worsen symptoms and avoidance of tartrazine does not improve symptoms; however, \"due to the paucity of evidence, it is not possible to provide firm conclusions as to the effects of tartrazine on asthma control\".\n[17]Regulation  [ edit]Canada  [ edit]Tartrazine is listed as a permitted food coloring in Canada.\n[18] The majority of pre-packaged foods are required to list all ingredients, including all food additives such as color; however section B.01.010 (3) (b) of the Regulations provide food manufacturers with the choice of declaring added color (s) by either their common name or simply as \"colour\".\n[19]In February 2010, Health Canada consulted the public and manufacturers on their plans to change the labelling requirements.\nHealth Canada felt that it might be prudent to require the identification of specific colors on food labels, to allow consumers to make better informed choices.\n[20] The results of the consultation supported increased transparency.\n[21] Some respondents proposed banning the use of synthetic food colors, however Health Canada found that existing scientific literature does not demonstrate that synthetic food coloring is unsafe in the general population; they are instead considering more transparent labelling to allow those with sensitivities to food color to make informed choices.\nThe relevant proposed regulatory changes will be developed and published for consultation in Part I of the Canada Gazette,  [22] the official newsletter of the Government of Canada.\nUnited Kingdom and EU  [ edit]The European Food Safety Authority allows for tartrazine to be used in processed cheese, canned or bottled fruit or vegetables, processed fish or fishery products, and wines and wine-based drinks.\n[23]  [24]In response to concerns about the safety of certain food additives, the UK FSA commissioned a study by researchers at Southampton University of the effect of a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine  (dubbed the \"Southampton 6\")) and sodium benzoate  (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages; the study published in 2007.\n[25]  [26] The study found \"a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity\" in the children;  [25]  [26] the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended.\n[25]The European regulatory community, with a stronger emphasis on the precautionary principle, required labelling and temporarily reduced the acceptable daily intake  (ADI) for the food colorings; the UK FSA called for voluntary withdrawal of the colorings by food manufacturers.\n[25]  [26] However, in 2009 the EFSA re-evaluated the data at hand and determined that \"the available scientific evidence does not substantiate a link between the color additives and behavioral effects.\"\n[25]  [27]United States  [ edit]The United States requires the presence of tartrazine to be declared on food and drug products (21 CFR 74.1705 (revised April 2013), 21 CFR 201.20) and also color batches to be preapproved by the United States Food and Drug Administration  (FDA).\n[13] As part of these regulations, the FDA requires that the Precautions section of prescription drug labels include the warning statement, \"This product contains FD+C Yellow No.\n5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons.\nAlthough the overall incidence of FD+C Yellow No.\n5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.\"\n[28]The FDA regularly seizes products if found to be containing undeclared tartrazine, declared but not FDA-tested, or labeled something other than FD&C yellow 5 or Yellow 5.\nSuch products seized often include noodles.\n[29]In 2010, the Center for Science in the Public Interest  (CSPI) called for the FDA to ban Yellow 5.\n[30] The FDA reviewed the data, and did not ban it.\n[25]Alternative coloring agents  [ edit]Organic foods typically use beta-Carotene or curcumin  (from turmeric) as an additive when a yellow color is wanted and annatto  (E160b) might be used for non organic foods.\nOther alternatives include chlorophyll (green), beet powder (red or pink), cocoa powder (brown), paprika (brown) and saffron (orange).\nMyths  [ edit]Rumors began circulating about tartrazine in the 1990s regarding a link to its consumption (specifically its use in Mountain Dew) and adverse effects on male potency, testicle and penis size, and sperm count.\nThere are no documented cases supporting the claim tartrazine will shrink a penis or cause it to stop growing.\n[31]  [32]Although tartrazine is one of various food colors said to cause food intolerance and ADHD -like behavior in children, evidence for this claim is lacking.\n[33] It is possible that certain food colorings may act as a trigger in those who are genetically predisposed, but the evidence is weak.\n[25]  [34]References  [ edit]^ Food Standards Australia New Zealand.\n\"Food Additives- Numerical List\".\nArchived from the original on June 25, 2009.\nRetrieved 2 December 2009.^ Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers, Food Standards Agency website, retrieved 15 Dec 2011^ \"Food Dyes\".\nCenter for Science in the Public Interest.\nRetrieved 8 March 2013.^ \"What is Food Coloring Made Of?\".\nWise\nGeek.\nRetrieved 8 March 2013.^ \"Acid Yellow 23\".\nChem\nBlink, an online database of chemicals from around the world.^ \"Tartrazine\".\ndrugs.com.^ \"Wayback Machine\".\nsiri.org.\nArchived from the original on 2016-03-03.^ Jain, Rajeev;

    "document": "California solar owners face new fees, utilities say costs should be higher States such as California, Arizona and Nevada have moved to increase fees on homeowners and businesses with solar panels.\n(AFP / Getty Images)California utility regulators narrowly passed new rules that will increase costs for owners of rooftop solar systems, part of a broad reshaping of the state's energy future.\nThe California Public Utilities Commission, on a 3-2 vote Thursday, stopped short of the even higher charges that the state's investor-owned utilities wanted.\nThe opposing commissioners said they voted against the proposal because of the last-minute elimination of an electricity transmission fee, a move that they said made the overall arrangement too rich for the solar industry.\nThe decision, which initially applies only to new solar panel systems, was viewed by some as a compromise.\nBut others say it's a defeat for the utilities.\nSouthern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric had pressed the commission to charge solar owners hefty fees that the solar industry said would crush their business.\nBy Edison's account, the average solar customer under the current structure has a monthly electric bill of about $82.\nUnder the commission's decision, that would increase to $91.\nA utility counterproposal would have increased it to $103.\n\"Our decision today is a big step forward,\" said commission President Michael R. Picker, who added that solar customers would face even higher costs over the next few years.\n\"It's a big step but it's only one of many.\n\"This has been a very difficult task, to find the right balance,\" Picker said.\n\"There's a shift in the way we use electricity.\n\u2026 [The decision] also forces the utility to come to grips with the technology challenges.\"\nThe slim passage of the measure came with commissioners Liane M. Randolph and Carla J. Peterman siding with Picker.\nThey noted, however, that with the new world of individual electricity generation on customers' rooftops, the utility and solar industries have much to learn.\n\"I think it really does strike the right balance with the information we have right now,\" Randolph said of the decision.\nBut concerns over fairness to non-solar customers and the effect on utilities led commissioners Mike Florio and Catherine J.\nK. Sandoval to oppose it.\nFlorio and Sandoval were particularly upset by a revision to the proposed decision late Wednesday afternoon that favored rooftop solar owners.\nThe solar industry had lobbied hard over the last week against a little-noticed footnote that would have required solar owners to pay an electricity transmission charge to ensure that they, like other ratepayers, paid their share of the cost of maintaining the electric grid of transmission wires and the like.\nSolar industry representatives said that the electricity transmission charge would have doubled the fees solar owners would have had to pay.\nWithout the transmission fee, solar owners faced an average $6 monthly charge.\nWith transmission costs, the monthly charge could have topped $12 for the average solar owner, potentially wiping out the savings that solar gave them.\nThe solar industry said the monthly cost could go as high as $18 a month.\nBut in the end, the revised proposal released by the commission Wednesday deleted transmission from the footnote and eliminated that monthly fee for solar owners.\n\"All of us are pro solar,\" but the final proposal didn't shift enough costs to solar users, Florio said.\n\"I don't think these benefits are going to accrue to solar customers, they're going to accrue to solar vendors.\"\nSandoval estimated that the cost breaks extended to solar panel owners could be as much as four times bigger than all the reductions offered to low-income utility customers.\nMuch of the nation awaited California's action on rooftop solar because the state leads on solar installations.\nSome states such as Nevada have rolled back rooftop solar benefits to a point that the solar industry intends to close operations in those locations.\nThe proposal's passage brought cheers not only from the solar industry but farmers and some business owners with solar panels on their roofs.\n\"We all know that California is a world leader when it comes to being green,\" said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar Energy Industries Assn.\n\"But today's vote is more than that.\nIt is about California continuing to champion innovation and a different way of doing things, in this case, building a smarter energy grid and allowing individual consumers to generate their own clean electricity.\"\nAt Full Belly Farm in California's Capay Valley, close to 80% of the packing shed energy usage is offset by solar generation.\nCo-owner Paul Muller said that the solar system \"alleviates stress on the grid at peak electricity hours, when our need for cooling and pumping water is greatest.\n...\nIt's absolutely essential.\"\nThe new monthly fees are just part of the overhaul of the rules governing the \"net energy metering\" policy, which allows solar panel owners to sell the extra energy they don't use back to the electricity grid.\nUnder the decision, new solar customers would face a one-time charge to tie into the grid.\nThe commission estimates the fee would range from $75 to $150 per solar customer.\nIn addition, rooftop solar customers would pay a fee estimated at 2 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity used from the utility companies, no matter how much power their solar systems generate.\nThis fee would amount to about $6 more a month for the average solar user.\nUtilities also would place new solar customers on time-of-use rates, which rise during periods of high electricity demand.\nSolar owners would still receive retail value for the electricity they produce in excess of what they use from the power company each month.\nBut on an annual basis, that benefit gets reduced to a wholesale value.\nThe new net-energy metering program will take effect for new customers after the utilities' reach certain participation caps, or July 1, 2017, whichever occurs first.\nExisting owners are exempted from all the changes for 20 years from when they installed their solar systems and connected to the grid.\nUtilities decried the new program as insufficient and unfair to non-solar customers.\n\"This decision puts the burden of subsidizing solar on low-income customers who can least afford it, and SCE believes that policy is unwise and unfair,\" said Pedro Pizarro, president of Southern California Edison.\nSan Diego Gas & Electric said that \"the California Public Utilities Commission ignored state law and the clear direction from the state Legislature, which called for them to reform net energy metering to ensure the benefits are balanced with the costs of the program.\"\nThe utilities argue that rooftop solar owners already benefit from a 30% federal solar investment tax credit, which Congress last month extended through 2019. ivan.penn@latimes.com\nCalifornia Inc.\nNewsletter\nWeekly\nA look back, and ahead, at the latest California business news.\nBe the first to comment\n\n",

    "document": "Surprising Facts To Why Bacon Is Healthy For You Surprising Facts To Why Bacon Is Healthy For You\nThis post was made possible by the generosity of another writer.\nBacon has held a bad reputation for health for several years and many people wonder if bacon is healthy.\nThe claims that bacon is high in fat, causes high cholesterol and ultimately leads to serious health conditions are not entirely true.\nBacon does have some surprising health benefits that make it a great addition to a diet plan when it is eaten in proper serving sizes.\nHealthy Nutrients In Bacon\nThe concern that bacon will ruin good health is a myth.\nAccording to Heesa Phadie, bacon has healthy nutrients that make it a useful part of a healthy diet.\nBacon contains thiamin, vitamin B12, zinc and selenium, which are all vital nutrients the body does not naturally produce.\nALSO READ: If You Love Bacon You Must Try This Bacon and Ale Trail\nThe B vitamins are a necessary part of fighting anemia and maintaining high energy levels throughout the day.\nSince bacon contains natural B vitamins, it is healthy for the body.\nThe vitamins are needed to move nutrients around the body through the circulatory system and a deficiency can lead to serious complications.\nZinc and selenium are vital antioxidants that are necessary for immune health.\nWhen the body does not receive enough nutrients and antioxidants, cells can start breaking down at a faster rate and the health is compromised.\nBacon is useful in fighting health problems because it contains healthy antioxidants.\nFat in Bacon\nBacon does contain fat, which resulted in the concerns to personal health.\nWhile bacon has some fat, it does not contain the most harmful form of fat.\nAccording to the website Fill\nYour\nPlate.org, bacon does not have any trans fats.\nThe most harmful form of fat is trans fats, which are created fats designed for preservation.\nBacon does contain fat, but the amount is exaggerated.\nA single serving of bacon has less fat than many consumers assume.\nAccording to Boss Hog on the website Bacon\nToday.com, bacon has less fat and cholesterol than many popular cuts of beef and chicken.\nThe low fat content when compared to the amount of nutritional value is surprising.\nBoss Hog explains that bacon has the highest protein to fat content of any meat, which makes it a great option when following a high protein diet or after exercise.\nImproved Mood\nThe meat is surprisingly nutritious and good for mental health.\nBacon is a natural mood enhancer that helps encourage positive mental states.\nAccording to Visual.ly, the umami in bacon is an addictive substance that has a neurological impact on the brain.\nBoss Hog on Bacon Today states that the meat causes a happy and blissful effect after eating it.\nThe effect causes improved mood, satisfaction and lowers stress levels.\nSince stress is a serious complication to physical and mental health, it is important to take measures to control the harmful emotional state.\nWhile several other options are available to reduce stress, many solutions take time.\nWhen time is short, grabbing a piece of bacon can help enhance mood and reduce stress levels within a short period of time.\nProtection To The Heart\nA surprising fact is that bacon is healthy for the heart.\nBacon contains omega-3 fatty acids, which are the same nutrients found in fish.\nThe healthy benefits of omega fatty acids are the reduced cholesterol and improved overall health in the heart.\nDespite the myth that bacon causes heart disease, it actually has a positive benefit on the heart and body.\nHigh cholesterol is a problem for many individuals, but a serving of bacon can help reduce the bad numbers while raising the good numbers over time.\nAccording to Boss Hog, choline is another material that helps protect the heart from damage and disease.\nBacon can help heal the heart and other organs in the body due to the choline that is found in the meat.\nCholine is suggested for healing abnormalities and is a good element to add to a pregnant woman's diet due to the impact on fetal brain development.\nCholine improves fetal brain development when it is eaten regularly during pregnancy.\nReduced Rates Of Brain-Related Illnesses\nThe health of the brain is vital for the entire body.\nThe brain is the organ that controls the body and ensures everything functions appropriately.\nWhen problems develop in the brain, it leads to odd behaviors, memory loss and ultimately death when it is not properly managed.\nAccording to Boss Hog, the choline in bacon is not only useful for the heart.\nCholine is a necessary component for the health of the brain.\nA diet that contains choline on a regular basis will show reduced rates of memory loss over time.\nIt is used in treatment for mental impairments, including Alzheimer's Disease and similar dementia diseases.\nStudies have shown that choline improves memory, intelligence testing and reduces the speed of damage to the brain from dementia.\nThe impact on the brain is useful at any age.\nSince it improves memory, bacon is a great addition to breakfast during the school years.\nBacon is not bad for the body or health.\nSince the meat contains a high level of nutrients, it is a useful addition to any diet.\nThe key to eating bacon and gaining health benefits is keeping the portions to reasonable sizes.\nWhen eaten in proper portion sizes, the amount of salt and fat is a negligible concern and the health benefits will outweigh the possible downsides associated with the meat.\nMake Bacon at Home with Recipes on Pinterest\nFollow Bacon is Magic's board Charcuterie and Salumi Recipes on Pinterest.\nReferences:\nBacon Today

    "document": "Transport from the Providenciales Airport to Grace Bay Providenciales International Airport (PLS)Airport Road, Providenciales\nOur Opinion\nUnfortunately, the country's main airport has most of the problems associated with large airports and none of the advantages.\nFree Wi\nFi is provided, but the connection rarely works.\nLuggage carts are not complimentary (unlike in many European and Asian airports) and cost $5 USD (foreign currency and cards not accepted), despite the distance from the baggage carousel to taxi pickup being around only 150 feet (50 metres).\nThe Skylounge viewing deck is closed for many early-morning flights.\nSaturday and Sunday check-in times can be very long due to the high number of flights.\nParking is extremely expensive.3 star rating for Providenciales International Airport (PLS) by Visit Turks and Caicos Islands\nAerial view of the airport.\nYou may also be interested in International Flights to the Turks and Caicos Islands, Passports and Visas, Customs Allowances and Getting Around Providenciales.\nAll international flights to the Turks and Caicos Islands arrive at the Providenciales International Airport, a small one terminal building with one 9,199 foot (2,804 metre) runway.\nThe island of Provo welcomes regularly-scheduled flights from over two dozen international cities, including London, New York, Washington D.\nC., Miami, Toronto, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia and Atlanta.\nSeveral international airlines fly to the Turks and Caicos, including British Airways, American Airlines, United, Air Canada, Delta, Jet Blue, West Jet, and Inter\nCaribbean.\nAll airlines share a general ticketing and check-in hall.\nThere are no satellite terminals.\nThe Providenciales Airport IATA Code is PLS, the ICAO Code MBPV.\nCheck-in Times\nProvidenciales International Airport Facts\nAirport Code IATA: PLS, ICAO: MBPVRunway Length 9,199 feet (2,804 meters)Elevation 15 feet (5 meters)Runway Direction 10/28Clearance Status International Entry\nCar Parking $2 per hour, $25 per day\nMost airlines recommend at least 2 hours before international flights.\nFor domestic flights, 45 minutes is sufficient.\nThe bulk of international passengers arrive 2 hours before departure.\nIf you arrive 10-15 minutes before this, the lines will be significantly shorter.\nSaturday and Sunday Flights\nYou should give yourself additional time to check-in on Saturday and Sunday.\nThere is a high number of flights on these days and this can lead to delays in check-in and security.\nImmigration, Passport, and Customs Information\nThe Providenciales International Airport welcomes flights from dozens of international destinations.\nSee also\nPassports and Visas\nCustoms Allowances\nBringing Food into the Turks and Caicos\nYou'll need to clear immigration and collect your baggage before proceeding through customs.\nUnlike in some other Caribbean airports (such as Nassau), there are no pre-clearance facilities operated by the U.\nS. Customs and Border Protection for U.\nS. Nationals returning home.\nThe Providenciales International Airport is a relatively small facility, and only has one baggage carousel.\nDuring typical conditions, there isn't much of a wait for luggage, and custom is efficient as well.\nLuggage carts ($5 usage fee) and porters are onsite.\nTerminal Facilities and Services\nThere is one departure lounge each for international and domestic flights.\nThe international lounge can become crowded at times, but plans are underway for expansion.\nThe check-in hall features an open-air design, and has both traditional check-in counters with staff, and automated kiosks for some of the major airlines.\nBefore the international security checkpoint, there are resin copies of the stones from the Sapodilla Bay Hill Rock Carvings.\nThe international departure lounge features two levels, and seating is found in both areas.\nThe upper level also offers an outdoor viewing deck and limited amounts of seating, as well as a VIP and first class lounge.\nInternet\nThe departure lounge is covered by a complimentary Flow Wi\nFi hot spot.\nUnfortunately, the connection doesn't always function, and is often poor when it is operational.\nShopping and Eating\nA restaurant, Gilly's Restaurant, is found outside the security checkpoint in the main terminal.\nGilly's Caf\u00e9, a small bar which also serves food, is located in the upper level of the international departure lounge.\nSeveral gift and souvenir, duty-free, and jewellery shops are located on the lower level of the departure lounge.\nCurrency Exchange\nThere is no Bureau de Change at the airport.\nYou are advised to exchange currency before you arrive.\nCurrency can be exchanged at local banks, but the fees are exorbitant and queues can be over an hour for service.\nGround Transportation and Taxis\nThe typical flight approach to the Providenciales is highly scenic and flies over the spectacular Chalk Sound National Park.\nTaxis and cars (both private and rental) are the only forms of ground transportation from the airport.\nTaxis are available directly outside the baggage claim area.\nWe advise you to confirm your fare (total for all passengers) before setting off.\nThere are fixed fares as set in the ordinance (and often posted by other information sources), but these are not always respected.\nWe recommend that most visitors

    "document": "Customer Service: What is Uber's phone number? from: Top 6 Ways To Contact Uber When You Need Help\nSometimes I like to joke that one of the reasons why my site is so popular is because Uber and Lyft are so bad at customer service.\nI can't tell you how many times I've e-mailed Uber with a question only to get a completely stock reply that often doesn't even answer the original question.\nI've gotten really good at asking only one question at a time and making sure that I keep it super simple for those guys.\nI will give Uber some credit though, because even though the answer isn't usually what you want to hear, or even what you asked about, at least they respond pretty promptly these days (within 1-2 hours IME).\nMy good buddies at Lyft on the other hand, are averaging around 2-3 days response time and that's if you can even get a response.\nI'd say about 50% of the time, driver's e-mails get lost in a black hole somewhere up in San Francisco never to be seen again.\nClearly these guys haven't mastered customer service yet and that is one of the reasons why I work so hard to answer all of your questions that come in.\nI can't respond to every Tweet or Facebook comment but I do respond to every question posted over on the Q&A Forum or via e-mail.\nJust make sure you do a little searching beforehand.\nIf you ask me a question that is easily Google-able or that I've already answered a million times you're likely to get an Uber-like response out of me\nWith that being said, there are still a lot of questions that you'll need to turn to Uber for and there are certain things that they're very good at answering and dealing with.\nI've compiled an epic list of all the places that you can go to get help from Uber (no matter what city you're in).\nUber's Local Partner Websites\nThis is a much lesser known resource but since they're maintained by individual Uber cities (or regions) there is some really valuable information on these sites.\nNow you won't find the same information on every site but there is a lot of good stuff.\nJust some examples of what you can find on these sites:\nUber Support E-mail Address\nLocal in-person office hours\nAccepted vehicles for Uber\nPlus/Select, Uber\nXL, etc\nHere are some of the sites, for a full list, check out my spreadsheet here.\nSF \u2013 http://www.sfuberpartners .com/SD \u2013 http:// www.driveubersd.co m /NYC \u2013 http://www.driveubernyc.c om/West Coast Cities/States \u2013 http://ubersupport.weebly .com/Update (11/6/15): Help For Uber Passengers\nIf you had any problems with one of your Uber rides as a passenger, the fastest way to get help is to actually reply to your e-mail receipt.\nUnhappy with Uber?\nYou can always try the friendlier alternative: Lyft\nNew passengers get free ride credit!Emergency Accident Hotline\nThis number is only for emergencies.\nSo if you get into an accident while driving, this is the only time you should ever call this number.\nI'm almost hesitant to give it out since I know some people will abuse it but I know it could come in handy just in case.\nI added it to my phone as 'Uber Emergency' so add it now before you forget!Update (7/20/15): Uber has disconnected this number.\nThere is no longer a way to contact Uber by phone.http://Help.\nUber.co m\nUber actually revamped their entire help section at some point in the past couple months and it's actually pretty helpful now.\nThe only problem is that they didn't really tell drivers about it, or maybe I just wasn't paying attention.\nEither way, there is a lot of good basic information when you go to http://help.uber.com now.help.\nUber.com\nThe reason why I like going here for help first is because the people who write this content all work at Uber's corporate office and they carefully review everything that goes up on this page.\nWhen you e-mail Uber, you're going to be dealing with a CS rep who is probably making $10/hr so you can imagine that their insight and knowledge about driver issues will be somewhat limited.\nOne really cool feature that I did find with this page is that when you login/select a city, the site actually becomes personalized and you can get help based off your specific account.\nAfter you click sign in, the page should change to the following:help.\nUber.com\nYou can then select specific trips for review, or get custom tailored help for your situation/city.\nE-mailing Uber\nIf you are having any issues with your account, have questions or just need policies explained, the next best way to get support is by e-mailing your local Uber office.\nI've created a spreadsheet here that has every Uber city and the associated partner e-mail.\nSome of the smaller Uber cities may not have their own support e-mail and in that case you should e-mail the closest Uber city.\nOr you can also try the general support e-mail for Uber: http://mailto:support@ube r.com\nUber Support E-mail Addresses\nIn my experience, Uber has dramatically increased their response time these days and I often receive responses within 1-2 hours and sometimes even sooner.\nNow, the responses aren't always the best but here are some tips for dealing with Uber CS:\nOne question at a time: I honestly think they have a policy of not being allowed to answer more than 1 question per e-mail.\nSometimes I will ask two very distinct questions just to test them and they will only answer one.\nVery strange..\nReply if you want the same person: Once you get a CS rep, as long as you reply to that e-mail chain, it will go back to the same CS rep.\nBut if that rep goes home for the day or the weekend, it may be a while before you hear back.\nNew e-mail if you want a new person: In forum speak, we like to call this HUCA or Hang Up, Call Again.\nAll this means is that some reps are better than others and often you will get a completely different response (or maybe even the one you want) if you simply just hang up and call again.\nOr in this case, just by sending a new e-mail.\nDon't e-mail the same question over and over: Uber's system has a built-in feature that will auto-recognize similar queries and put them straight to the back of the queue.\nSo don't ask the same thing over and over, if anything ask a 'new question' but figure out a way to slip in your 'real question'.\nLocal Office Hours\nI haven't had the need to go into Uber's office hours yet but I know many drivers who have and have been pleasantly surprised.\nI don't mind dealing with Uber over e-mail but I know there are many of you who would prefer face to face interaction.\nIt seems like almost every major city now has office hours.\nYou can find your city's office hours by checking your local partner website or e-mailing Uber support.\nThis should be right up their alley\nHere are just a couple examples of current office hours for LA and SF.\nUber LA Office Hours (as of 3/26/2015)Uber San Francisco Office Hours (as of 3/26/2015)Twitter As A Last Resort\nI love using Twitter to contact companies since they usually put their best customer service reps on their social media teams.\nBut Uber does not do that and I haven't even received a response to one of my tweets in quite some time.\nMaybe you'll have better luck though..\nYou can find a list of every Uber City's Twitter accounts here.\nUpdate (11/5/15): Uber Now Has Live Chat\nDrivers have been reporting having good success with Uber chat and I recently tried it out for myself.\nThe chat representative that I got was available instantly and turned out to be somewhat helpful.\nI haven't tried it out yet for more complicated problems but just another good resource to have.\nYou can chat with an Uber representative from 5 AM to 12 AM pacific time by going here: t.uber.com/chatwithus\nSo there you have it, those are all of the ways you can use to contact Uber.\nUber does have a lot of good information spread out across the web, they just do a horrible job of organizing it all.\nI hope that they do a better job in the future but if not, I'll do my best to keep providing all the pertinent information you need to thrive.- See more at:

ETHeard on Tell Me More\nUnder most laws, young people are recognized as adults at age 18.\nBut emerging science about brain development suggests that most people don't reach full maturity until the age 25.\nGuest host Tony Cox discusses the research and its implications with Sandra Aamodt, neuroscientist and co-author of the book Welcome to Your Child's Brain.\nTONY COX, host: I'm Tony Cox and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News.\nMichel Martin is away.\nWe'd like to spend this part of the program talking about the passage from childhood to adulthood and how that may be tougher for one distinct group of young people.\nMost of the privileges and responsibilities of adulthood are legally granted by the age of 18.\nThat's when you can vote, enlist in the military, move out on your own, but is that the true age of maturity?\nA growing body of science says, no.\nThat critical parts of the brain involved in decision-making are not fully developed until years later at age 25 or so.\nIn a moment, we'll hear about how child advocates are hoping to use this research to change the laws about their foster care.\nBut first, to learn more about adolescent brain development and maturity, we are joined now by neuroscientist, Sandra Aamodt.\nShe is the coauthor of the book, \"Welcome to Your Child's Brain: How the Mind Grows from Conception to College.\n\"Sandra, welcome to the program.\nIt's nice to have you.\nDr. SANDRA AAMODT: It's nice to be here.\nCOX: Is this idea that the brains of 18 year olds aren't fully developed a matter of settled science?\nAAMODT: Yes.\nThe car rental companies got to it first, but neuroscientists have caught up and brain scans show clearly that the brain is not fully finished developing until about age 25.\nCOX: To not be too clinical in the spin that we put on this, what parts of the brain are we talking about and what changes happen between the ages of 18 and, let's say, 25?\nAAMODT: So the changes that happen between 18 and 25 are a continuation of the process that starts around puberty, and 18 year olds are about halfway through that process.\nTheir prefrontal cortex is not yet fully developed.\nThat's the part of the brain that helps you to inhibit impulses and to plan and organize your behavior to reach a goal.\nAnd the other part of the brain that is different in adolescence is that the brain's reward system becomes highly active right around the time of puberty and then gradually goes back to an adult level, which it reaches around age 25 and that makes adolescents and young adults more interested in entering uncertain situations to seek out and try to find whether there might be a possibility of gaining something from those situations.\nCOX: So this is important.\nAre the physiological changes in the brain, in terms of the development of young people, as significant and impactful as the cultural changes and environmental changes that they go through vis-a-vis peer pressure things of that sort?\nAAMODT: Well, actually, one of the side effects of these changes in the reward system is that adolescents and young adults become much more sensitive to peer pressure than they were earlier or will be as adults.\nSo, for instance, a 20 year old is 50 percent more likely to do something risky if two friends are watching than if he's alone.\nCOX: Is there a difference between males and females with regard to their brain development, particularly in this age category?\nAAMODT: Females' brains develop about on average two years earlier than male brains, so you're more likely to have a late developing male brain than female.\nCOX: So when females say they're smarter than guys, it really is true?\nAAMODT: Especially around about the age of 15 or so.\nYes.\nCOX: What does this mean?\nIn a minute, we're going to be hearing from some advocates who think that the foster care system needs to be changed, in that in some states, when you reach the age of 18, you are booted out of foster care and their argument is based on some of the research that you are now citing that these young people are not really ready for the adult world.\nWhat is the impact for someone who lives in a foster care kind of setting as far as their brain development is concerned?\nAAMODT: One of the things that deprived childhood causes is problems with prefrontal cortex function, so somebody who has had an unstable home life is more likely to have trouble with planning and organizing behavior and with inhabiting impulses than somebody who has had a stable life.\nCOX: Would you say, based on the research that you are now citing, that it would make more sense to have the legal age become 25 instead of 18 or 21 in some cases?\nAAMODT: I think it makes sense to have different ages for different functions.\nObviously some 18 year olds are competent to go out into the world and handle things by themselves and some of them aren't.\nIt would be nice if we had a little more flexibility to distinguish the two in the legal system.\nCOX: Final thing is, if these age limits are not adjusted to take into account the effect that the research has shown, what is the price - if I can put it that way - that society will end up paying down the road?\nI know that's a pretty large question.\nBut another way of saying it is how important is it for us to address this and do something about it now?\nAAMODT: Many of the costs of adolescents are actually - what we think of as the costs of adolescence, the risks of crime and car accidents and all the crazy things that adolescents do are actually more issues with young adults, people in the 18 to 25 age range, largely because they have more opportunities to get into these kinds of trouble because they have less parental supervision than the younger adolescents do.\nCOX: Sandra Aamodt is a neuroscientist and the co-author of \"Welcome to Your Child's Brain: How the Mind Grows from Conception to College.\"\nShe joined us from Capital Public Radio in Sacramento, California.\nSandra, thank you very much.\nAAMODT: Thank you.\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.\nAll rights reserved.\nVisit our website terms of use and permissions

    "document": "Race and ethnicity in the United States Census From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search\nRace and ethnicity in the United States Census, defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) and the United States Census Bureau, are self-identification data items in which residents choose the race or races with which they most closely identify, and indicate whether or not they are of Hispanic or Latino origin (the only categories for ethnicity ).\n[1]  [2]The racial categories represent a social-political construct for the race or races that respondents consider themselves to be and, \"generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country.\"\n[3] OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the U.\nS. Census as not \"scientific or anthropological\" and takes into account \"social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry\", using \"appropriate scientific methodologies\" that are not \"primarily biological or genetic in reference.\"\n[4] The race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.\n[5]Race and ethnicity are considered separate and distinct identities, with Hispanic or Latino origin asked as a separate question.\nThus, in addition to their race or races, all respondents are categorized by membership in one of two ethnic categories, which are \"Hispanic or Latino\" and \"Not Hispanic or Latino\".\nHowever, the practice of separating \"race\" and \"ethnicity\" as different categories has been criticized both by the American Anthropological Association and members of U.\nS. Commission on Civil Rights.\n[6]  [7]In 1997, OMB issued a Federal Register notice regarding revisions to the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity.\n[8] OMB developed race and ethnic standards in order to provide \"consistent data on race and ethnicity throughout the Federal Government.\nThe development of the data standards stem in large measure from new responsibilities to enforce civil rights laws.\"\nAmong the changes, OMB issued the instruction to \"mark one or more races\" after noting evidence of increasing numbers of interracial children and wanting to capture the diversity in a measurable way and having received requests by people who wanted to be able to acknowledge their or their children's full ancestry rather than identifying with only one group.\nPrior to this decision, the Census and other government data collections asked people to report only one race.\n[3]Contents [ hide ]1 How data on race and ethnicity are used2 Brief overview of race and ethnicity in the U.\nS.

Census' history  [ edit]Further information: Race and ethnicity in the United States\nExternal image\"Government Collection of Race and Ethnicity Data\", Center for American Progress, February 6, 2015.\nAn illustrated history of the racial and ethnic categories used in the U.\nS. Census from 1790 through 2010.\n[9]18th and 19th centuries  [ edit]1790 Census  [ edit]In 1790, first official year of the U.\nS. Census, these questions were asked, four of which had racial implications:\nNumber of free white males aged under 16 years\nNumber of free white males aged 16 years and upward\nNumber of free white females\nNumber of other free people\nNumber of slaves  [10]In 1800 and 1810, the age question regarding free white males was more detailed.\n[10]1820 Census  [ edit]The 1820 census built on the questions asked in 1810 by asking age questions about slaves.\nAlso the term \"colored\" entered the census nomenclature.\nIn addition, a question stating \"Number of foreigners not naturalized\" was included.\n[10]1830 Census  [ edit]For the 1830 census, a new question which stated \"The number of White persons who were foreigners not naturalized\" was included.\n[10]1850 Census  [ edit]The 1850 census saw a dramatic shift in the way information about residents was collected.\nFor the first time, free persons were listed individually instead of by head of household.\nThere were two questionnaires: one for free inhabitants and one for slaves.\nThe question on the free inhabitants schedule about color was a column that was to be left blank if a person was white, marked \"B\" if a person was black, and marked \"M\" if a person was mulatto.\nSlaves were listed by owner, and classified by gender and age, not individually, and the question about color was a column that was to be marked with a \"B\" if the slave was black and an \"M\" if mulatto.\n[10]1870 Census  [ edit]For the 1870 census, the color/racial question was expanded to include \"C\" for Chinese, which was a category that included all east Asians, as well as \"I\" for American Indians.\n[10]1890 Census  [ edit]For 1890, the Census Office changed the design of the population questionnaire.\nResidents were still listed individually, but a new questionnaire sheet was used for each family.\nAdditionally, this was the first year that the census distinguished between different East Asian races, such as Japanese and Chinese, due to increased immigration.\nThis census also marked the beginning of the term \"race\" in the questionnaires.\nEnumerators were instructed to write \"White,\" \"Black,\" \" Mulatto ,\" \" Quadroon ,\" \" Octoroon ,\" \"Chinese,\" \"Japanese,\" or \" Indian .\"\n[10]1900 Census  [ edit]During 1900, the \"Color or Race\" question was slightly modified, removing the term \"Mulatto\".\nAlso, there was an inclusion of an \"Indian Population Schedule\" in which \"enumerators were instructed to use a special expanded questionnaire for American Indians living on reservations or in family groups off of reservations.\"\nThis expanded version included the question \"Fraction of person's lineage that is white.\"\n[10]20th century  [ edit]1910 Census  [ edit]The 1910 census was similar to that of 1900, but it included a reinsertion of \"Mulatto\" and a question about the respondent's \"mother tongue.\"\n\"Ot\" was also added to signify \"other races\", with space for a race to be written in.\nThis decade's version of the Indian Population Schedule featured questions asking the individual's proportion of white, black, or American Indian lineage.\n[10]1920 Census  [ edit]The 1920 census questionnaire was similar to 1910, but excluded a separate schedule for American Indians.\n\"Hin\", \"Kor\", and \"Fil\" were also added to the \"Color or Race\" question, signifying Hindustani (South Asia Indian), Korean, and Filipino, respectively.\n[10]1930 Census  [ edit]The biggest change in this year's census was in racial classification.\nEnumerators were instructed to no longer use the \"Mulatto\" classification.\nInstead, they were given special instructions for reporting the race of interracial persons.\nA person with both white and black ancestry (termed \"blood\") was to be recorded as \"Negro,\" no matter the fraction of that lineage (the \" one-drop rule \").\nA person of mixed black and American Indian ancestry was also to be recorded as \"Neg\" (for \"Negro\") unless he was considered to be \"predominantly\" American Indian and accepted as such within the community.\nA person with both White and American Indian ancestry was to be recorded as an Indian, unless his American Indian ancestry was small, and he was accepted as white within the community.\nIn all situations in which a person had White and some other racial ancestry, he was to be reported as that other race.\nPersons who had minority interracial ancestry were to be reported as the race of their father.\nFor the first and only time, \"Mexican\" was listed as a race.\nEnumerators were instructed that all persons born in Mexico, or whose parents were born in Mexico, should be listed as Mexicans, and not under any other racial category.\nBut, in prior censuses and in 1940, enumerators were instructed to list Mexican Americans as white, perhaps because some of them were of white background (mainly Spanish), many others mixed white and Native American and some of them Native American.\n[ citation needed]The Supplemental American Indian questionnaire was back, but in abbreviated form.\nIt featured a question asking if the person was of full or mixed American Indian ancestry.\n[10]  [11]1940 Census  [ edit]President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted a \"good neighbor\" policy that sought better relations with Mexico.\nIn 1935 a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law.\nMexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white.\nThe State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white.\nThis policy encouraged the League of United Latin American Citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness.\n[12]The 1940 census was the first to include separate population and housing questionnaires.\n[10] The race category of \"Mexican\" was eliminated in 1940, and the population of Mexican descent was counted with the White population.\n[13]1940 census data was used for Japanese American internment.\nThe Census Bureau's role was denied for decades, but was finally proven in 2007.\n[14]  [15]1950 Census  [ edit]The 1950 Census questionnaire removed the word \"color\" from the racial question, and also removed Hindu and Korean from the race choices.\n[10]1960 Census  [ edit]The 1960 Census re-added the word \"color\" to the racial question, and changed \"Indian\" to \"American Indian\", as well as added Hawaiian, Part-Hawaiian, Aleut, and Eskimo.\nThe Other (print out race) option was removed.\n[10]1970 Census  [ edit]This year's census included \"Negro or Black\", re-added Korean and the Other race option.\nEast Indians (the term used at that time for people whose ancestry is from the Indian subcontinent) were counted as White.\nThere was a questionnaire that was asked of only a sample of respondents.\nThese questions were as follows:a.\nWhere was this person born?\nb.\nIs this person's origin or descent...\nMexican\nPuerto Rican\nCuban\nCentral or South American\nOther Spanish\nNone of These\nWhat country was the person's father born in?\nWhat country was the person's mother born in?a.\nFor persons born in a foreign country- Is the person naturalized?\nb.\nWhen did the person come to the United States to stay?\nWhat language, other than English, was spoken in the person's home as a child?\nSpanish\nFrench\nItalian\nGerman\nOther\nNone, only English  [10]1980 Census  [ edit]This year added several options to the race question, including Vietnamese, Indian (East), Guamanian, Samoan, and re-added Aleut.\nAgain, the term \"color\" was removed from the racial question, and the following questions were asked of a sample of respondents:\nIn what state or foreign country was the person born?\nIf this person was born in a foreign country... a.\nIs this person a naturalized citizen of the United States?\nb.\nWhen did this person come the United States to stay?a.\nDoes this person speak a language other than English at home?\nb.\nIf yes, what is this language?\nc. If yes, how well does this person speak English?\nWhat is this person's ancestry?\n[10]1990 Census  [ edit]The racial categories in this year are as they appear in the 2000 and 2010 Census.\nThe following questions were asked of a sample of respondents for the 1990 Census:\nIn what U.\nS. State or foreign country was this person born?\nIs this person a citizen of the United States?\nIf this person was not born in the United States, when did this person come to the United States to stay?\n[10]The 1990 Census was not designed to capture multiple racial responses, and when individuals marked the Other race option and provided a multiple write in, the response was assigned according to the race written first.\n\"For example, a write in of \"Black-White\" was assigned a code of Black, a write in of \"White-Black\" was assigned a code of White.\"\n[3]In the United States, census data indicate that the number of children in interracial families grew from less than one half million in 1970 to about two million in 1990.\nIn 1990, for interracial families with one white American partner, the other parent...was Asian American for 45 percent...  [16]2000 Census  [ edit]Race was asked differently in the Census 2000 in several other ways than previously.\nMost significantly, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities.\nData show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members of two or more races.\nBecause of these changes, the Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from the 1990 census or earlier censuses.\nUse of caution is therefore recommended when interpreting changes in the racial composition of the US population over time.\nThe following definitions apply to the 2000 census only.\n[17]White.\nA person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.\nIt includes people who indicate their race as \"White\" or report entries such as Irish, German, English, Scandinavian, Scottish, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.\n[17]Black or African American.\nA person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.\nIt includes people who indicate their race as \"Black, African Am.\"\nor provide written entries such as Kenyan, Nigerian, or Haitian.\n[17]American Indian and Alaska Native.\nA person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment.\n[17]Asian.\nA person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nIt includes \"Asian Indian\", \"Chinese\", \"Filipino\", \"Korean\", \"Japanese\", \"Vietnamese\", and \"Other Asian\".\n[17]Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.\nA person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.\nIt includes people who indicate their race as \"Native Hawaiian\", \"Guamanian or Chamorro\", \"Samoan\", and \"Other Pacific Islander\".\n[17]Some other race.\nIncludes all other responses not included in the \"White\", \"Black or African American\", \"American Indian and Alaska Native\", \"Asian\" and \"Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\" race categories described above.\nRespondents providing write-in entries such as multiracial, mixed, interracial, We-Sort, or a Hispanic/Latino group (for example, Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban) in the \"Some other race\" category are included here.\n[17]Two or more races.\nPeople may have chosen to provide two or more races either by checking two or more race response check boxes, by providing multiple write-in responses, or by some combination of check boxes and write-in responses.\n[17]Snapshot: Race in the US Census\nThe 23rd federal census, 2010  [18] asks one ethnic and one race question (questions 1-4 not reproduced here, questions 5 and 6 paraphrased):\nIs the person of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin?\nNo, not of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin\nYes, Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano\nYes, Puerto Rican\nYes, Cuban\nYes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin \u2014 Print origin, for example, Argentinian, Colombian, Dominican, Nicaraguan, Salvadoran, Spaniard, and so on.\nWhat is the person's race?\nWhite\nBlack or African American\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native \u2014 Print name of enrolled or principal tribe.\nAsian Indian\nChinese\nFilipino\nOther Asian \u2014 Print race, for example, Hmong, Laotian, Thai, Pakistani, Cambodian, and so on.\nJapanese\nKorean\nVietnamese\nNative Hawaiian\nGuamanian or Chamorro\nSamoan\nOther Pacific Islander \u2014 Print race, for example, Fijian, Tongan, and so on.\nSome other race \u2014 Print race.\nThis census acknowledged that \"race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.\n\"The federal government of the United States has mandated that \"in data collection and presentation, federal agencies are required to use a minimum of two ethnicities: \"Hispanic or Latino\" and \"Not Hispanic or Latino\".\n[19] The Census Bureau defines \"Hispanic or Latino\" as \"a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.\"\n[19] For discussion of the meaning and scope of the Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, see the Hispanic and Latino Americans and Racial and ethnic demographics of the United States articles.\nUse of the word \"ethnicity\" for Hispanics only is considerably more restricted than its conventional meaning, which covers other distinctions, some of which are covered by the \"race\" and \"ancestry\" questions.\nThe distinct questions accommodate the possibility of Hispanic and Latino Americans' also declaring various racial identities (see also White Hispanic and Latino Americans, Asian Latinos, and Black Hispanic and Latino Americans ).\nIn the 2000 Census, 12.5% of the US population reported \"Hispanic or Latino\" ethnicity and 87.5% reported \"Not-Hispanic or Latino\" ethnicity.\n[19]21st century  [ edit]2010 Census  [ edit]The 2010 US Census included changes designed to more clearly distinguish Hispanic ethnicity as not being a race.\nThat included adding the sentence: \"For this census, Hispanic origins are not races.\"\n[20]  [21] Additionally, the Hispanic terms were modified from \"Hispanic or Latino\" to \"Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin\".\n[20]  [21]Although used in the Census and the American Community Survey, \"Some other race\" is not an official race,  [19] and the Bureau considered eliminating it prior to the 2000 Census.\n[22] As the 2010 census form did not contain the question titled \"Ancestry\" found in prior censuses, there were campaigns to get non-Hispanic West Indian Americans,  [23] Turkish Americans,  [24] Armenian Americans, Arab Americans and Iranian Americans to indicate their ethnic or national background through the race question, specifically the \"Some other race\" category.\n[25]  [26]  [27]The Interagency Committee has suggested that the concept of marking multiple boxes be extended to the Hispanic origin question, thereby freeing individuals from having to choose between their parents' ethnic heritages.\nIn other words, a respondent could choose both \"Hispanic or Latino\" and \"Not Hispanic or Latino\".\n[28]Relation between ethnicity and race in census results  [ edit]The Census Bureau warns that data on race in 2000 Census are not directly comparable to those collected in previous censuses.\n[17] Many residents of the United States consider race and ethnicity to be the same.\n[4]Population distribution by race (2000 census)  [29]Race Hispanic or

1.0 0.1 3,299,271 1.3 1.2In the 2000 Census, respondents were tallied in each of the race groups they reported.\nConsequently, the total of each racial category exceeds the total population because some people reported more than one race.\n[3]According to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations in the 2000 Census the largest part white biracial population is white/Native American and Alaskan Native, at 7,015,017, followed by white/black at 737,492, then white/Asian at 727,197, and finally white/Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander at 125,628.\n[30]The Census Bureau implemented a Census Quality Survey, gathering data from about 50,000 households to assess the reporting of race and Hispanic origin in the 2000 Census with the purpose of creating a way to make comparisons between the 2000 Census with previous Census racial data.\n[3]In September 1997, during the process of revision of racial categories previously declared by OMB directive no.\n15, the American Anthropological Association  (AAA) recommended that OMB combine the \"race\" and \"ethnicity\" categories into one question to appear as \"race/ethnicity\" for the 2000 US Census.\nThe Interagency Committee agreed, stating that \"race\" and \"ethnicity\" were not sufficiently defined and \"that many respondents conceptualize 'race' and 'ethnicity' as one in the same [ sic] underscor [ing] the need to consolidate these terms into one category, using a term that is more meaningful to the American people.\"\n[4]The AAA also stated,The American Anthropological Association recommends the elimination of the term \"race\" from OMB Directive 15 during the planning for the 2010 Census.\nDuring the past 50 years, \"race\" has been scientifically proven to not be a real, natural phenomenon.\nMore specific, social categories such as \"ethnicity\" or \"ethnic group\" are more salient for scientific purposes and have fewer of the negative, racist connotations for which the concept of race was developed.\nYet the concept of race has become thoroughly\u2014and perniciously\u2014woven into the cultural and political fabric of the United States.\nIt has become an essential element of both individual identity and government policy.\nBecause so much harm has been based on \"racial\" distinctions over the years, correctives for such harm must also acknowledge the impact of \"racial\" consciousness among the U.\nS. populace, regardless of the fact that \"race\" has no scientific justification in human biology.\nEventually, however, these classifications must be transcended and replaced by more non-racist and accurate ways of representing the diversity of the U.\nS. population.\n[4]The recommendations of the AAA were not adopted by the Census Bureau for the 2000 or the 2010 Censuses.\nOther agencies  [ edit]In 2001, the National Institutes of Health adopted the new language to comply with the revisions to Directive 15,  [31] as did the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the United States Department of Labor in 2007.\n[32] See Race and ethnicity (EEO).\nSee also  [ edit]Historical racial and ethnic demographics of the United States\nLanguage Spoken at Home\nRace (human classification)Race and ethnicity in censuses\nRace and ethnicity in the United States\nRacial segregation in the United States\nClassification of ethnicity in the United Kingdom\nVisible minority\nReferences  [ edit]^ \"American Fact\nFinder Help: Race\".\nUnited States Census Bureau.\nRetrieved 2017-09-13.^ \"American Fact\nFinder Help: Hispanic or Latino origin\".\nUnited States Census Bureau.\nRetrieved 2017-09-13.^ a b c d e \"Questions and Answers for Census 2000 Data on Race\".\nUnited States Census Bureau.\nMarch 14, 2001.\nArchived from the original on April 5, 2001.\nRetrieved 2010-04-25.^ a b c d \"A Brief History of the OMB Directive 15\".\nAmerican Anthropological Association.\n1997.\nRetrieved 2007-05-18.^ a b \"American Fact\nFinder Help: Ethnic Groups\".\nUnited States Census Bureau.\nRetrieved 2017-09-13.^ Gerald A.

    "document": "Detailed Design Bread Crumbs: Home - SW_Dev_Proc - Arch & Det Des - Det Des\nDetailed design of the system is the last design activity before implementation begins.\nThe hardest design problems must be addressed by the detailed design or the design is not complete.\nThe detailed design is still an abstraction as compared to source code, but should be detailed enough to ensure that translation to source is a precise mapping instead of a rough interpretation.\nNote: As mentioned on the Interface Design page, many of the examples will be scoped to a particular part of the overall system under development.\nDetailed design artifacts are going to contain a large amount of details which, if included in full, would obscure the point of this page.\nThe detailed design should represent the system design in a variety of views where each view uses a different modeling technique.\nBy using a variety of views, different parts of the system can be made clearer by different views.\nSome views are better at elaborating a systems states whereas other views are better at showing how data flows within the system.\nOther views are better at showing how different system entities relate to each through class taxonomies for systems that are designed using an object-oriented approach.\nA template for detailed design would not be of much use since each detailed design is likely to be unique and quite different from other designs.\nWhat is helpful in regards to guidance on detailed design are examples.\nThis page provides some detailed design content for the example microwave oven system that is referenced periodically by this website.\nThe major sections of this web page are the following:\nStructural Chart\nControl-Flow Model\nClass Diagram\nCollaboration Diagram\nSequence Diagram\nActivity Diagram\nPseudocode\nV-Model Diagram\nStructural Chart\nThe intent of a structural chart is to specify the components (boxes) of the system under development along with the interactions (arcs) that take place between those components.\nThe structural chart diagram below is an overall system diagram for the microwave oven example and is therefore has a very high information density.\nData Dictionary:\nEntity Name\nType\nDescription\nAuto Cook Presets\nFUNCTIONLooks up proper power level and cooking time settings for a given auto cook preset food item\nAuto Defrost\nFUNCTIONDetermines correct power level and cooking time values based on type of meat and weight of meat being defrosted\nBeeper\nFUNCTIONSounds beeper tone for

cooking completes\nStart\nENUMERATIONIndicates that the Start button has been pushed (Start active = 1, Start inactive = 0)Stop/Clear interrupt\nENUMERATIONStop/Clear button indication signal (Stop/Clear active = 1, Stop/Clear inactive = 0)Timer\nFUNCTIONReceives an initial timer value then counts down the time to 00:00 and sends a signal to the beeper function to sound a tone.\nWeight of meat\nFLOATWeight of meat for defrosting in ounces\nControl-Flow Model\nA Control-Flow Diagram (CFD) models the flow of execution through data objects.\nThis is a venerable approach to specifying the flow design of a system with a great amount of precision.\nUML offers a collection of diagrams to convey the same type of system information.\nThese diagrams are activity diagrams, collaboration (object-interaction) diagrams, and sequence diagrams.\nEach rhomboid represents a software object and each directed arc represents a single flow of control ordinally segmented according to the call sequences.\nThe following control flow diagram models the control flow of the auto-defrost operation of the microwave oven example.\nData Dictionary:\nTerm\nDescription\nType\nRequirements
